## Idea
A group of students want a better way of practicing typing. These students wanted to be able to read books they enjoy
while at the same time type them out to practice typing better. To achieve this, the application needs to be able to provide
specific functionalities to the user. The user should be able to input their own choice of text through a file, either pdf, text,
or other file types; depending on what file the user in puts, they should also be able to select a specific page for typing practice.
Additionally, the user must be able to see their statistics and progression through typing practice using the application - statistics
for the current text being typed should also be displayed.
