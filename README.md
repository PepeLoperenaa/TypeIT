## Idea
A group of students wants a better way of practicing their typing. These students wanted to be able to read books they enjoy
while at the same time type them out to practice typing better. To achieve this, the application needs to be able to provide
specific functionalities to the user. The user should be able to input their own choice of text through a file, either pdf, text,
or other file types; depending on what file the user in puts, they should also be able to select a specific page for typing practice.
Additionally, the user must be able to see their statistics and progression through typing practice using the application - statistics
for the current text being typed should also be displayed.

Different users should be able to use the application on the same computer, at different times. In addition, different users 
should have different profiles where their personal stats are recorded. Users should also be able to select different difficulties for
each text they want to practice typing. To achieve this, the following game modes will be available - Casual: no trackers, type at your
own pace; Normal: stat trackers, type at your own pace; Hard: stat trackers with a timer for each section to be typed; Instant Death: 
all the previous modifiers, but a single mistake means you have to restart the entire section of text.

## Mockups

## Literature
Useful links APA style.
This links need to be added after doing reserach regarding the different frameworks etc. 
## Moscow method
The Moscow method is a prioritazion technique used for project management. This is done to reach a common understanding of the 
application and how it works. For the project TypeIT, the Moscow method was used to seperate the different functionalities and see 
what had more priority than others. As the moscow method, we have separated the different functionalities within the different 
priorities. After research and thinking about the different functionalities this is what we have thought about: 

### Must have:
- Receiving user input and parsing it to the application.
- User input in the text file.
- Typing screen.

### Should have: 
- Statistics.
- Achievements.

### Could have: 
- Making our own Text file type.
- FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).

### Will not have: 
- Multiplayer (Locally or online).
- Log in system (As it will be a local application).
