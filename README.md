## Idea
A group of students want a better way of practicing their typing. These students wanted to be able to read books they enjoy
while at the same time type them out to practice typing better. To achieve this, the application needs to be able to provide
specific functionalities to the user. The user should be able to input their own choice of text through a file, either pdf, text,
or other file types; depending on what file the user in puts, they should also be able to select a specific page for typing practice.
Additionally, the user must be able to see their statistics and progression through typing practice using the application - statistics
for the current text being typed should also be displayed.
how does it work, functionalities.

## Literature
Useful links APA style.
This links need to be added after doing reserach regarding the different frameworks etc. 
## Moscow method
The Moscow method is a prioritazion technique used for project management. This is done to reach a common understanding of the application and how it works. For the project TypeIT, the Moscow method was used to seperate the different functionalities and see what had more priority than others. As the moscow method, we have separated the different functionalities within the different priorities. After research and thinking about the different functionalities this is what we have thought about: 

### Must have:
- Receiving user input and parsing it to the application.
- User input in the text file.
- Typing screen.

### Should have: 
- Statistics.
- Achievements.

### Could have: 
- Making our own Text file type.
- FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).

### Will not have: 
- Multiplyer (Locally or online).
- Log in system (As it will be a local application).
