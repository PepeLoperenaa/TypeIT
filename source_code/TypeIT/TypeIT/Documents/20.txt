"You're right it is getting pretty late..." "I'm sorry about this Momongasan." Momonga sighed gently as though he didn't want Herohero to sense the  regret in his heart. "Well if it's like that then it's a shame... time flies so fast when you're having  fun." "I really did want to stay with you to the end but I'm about to fall asleep." "Ah  well you do sound pretty tired. Then you should log out soon and have  a good rest." "I'm really sorry... Momongasan. Although how long do you plan to stay  Guild Leader" "I intended to stay on until I was automatically logged out once the servers  shut down. Since it's still a ways off maybe someone might come by in the  meantime." "Is that so... still I really didn't expect this place to be so well preserved." At this moment Momonga was grateful that he had no way to show his  expressions. If he did Herohero would probably have seen his face twist up.  Even then his voice would betray how he truly felt so Momonga kept quiet in  order to suppress the feelings surging up within him. He had worked hard to maintain the guild precisely because he had built it up  along with everyone else but hearing words like these from one of his guild  members sparked a mix of complicated emotions in his heart. However these  feelings dispersed like mist as Herohero continued. "Momongasan you must have kept the guild going as its leader so we could  come back to it at any time. Thank you very much."
