But then- The Principality of Observation was consumed by a black fire, so intense that even Nigun, a good distance away, could feel the heat. He could barely keep his eyes open. The angel's body melted and vanished amidst the the sky-scorching black flames, without so much as the chance to resist. The flames that devoured the angel vanished with their target. No traces were left behind. The previous scene - that of the angel's attack and the black conflagration - felt like they had been illusions, like they had never happened. "How, how could this be." "In just one hit..." "Hiiiiiiii!" "Im-im-impossible!!!!!" Nigun shouted amidst his confusion. He did not even know he was shouting. He was simply converting his thoughts into words. It did not feel like shouting to him. The Principality of Observation was a high-tier angel whose offensive and defensive strength were in a 3:7 ratio. It boasted the strongest defense of all other angels in its tier. In addition, Nigun's natural-born talent, [Enhance Summoned Monster], could improve the stats of any monster Nigun summoned. As a result, there were very few people who could defeat a Principality of Observation summoned by Nigun.
