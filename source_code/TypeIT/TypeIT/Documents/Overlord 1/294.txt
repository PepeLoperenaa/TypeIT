A wave of black radiance erupted from Ainz like the negative image of a camera flash. It only lasted for an instant but it had an immediate and obvious effect. "Imimpossible..." Someone muttered those words carried by the wind. They could not believe what was happening before their eyes. The angels over 40 of them had been annihilated by the black wave. Their opponent had not used dispel magic to neutralize the summons. The angels that were blown away by the black wave had taken damage. In other words Ainz had used a powerful spell to wipe out all the angels in one fell swoop. Nigun could not help but tremble. He recalled the words of the Kingdom's strongest warrior Gazef Stronoff. "...Hmph you fool. In that village... is a man who is stronger than me. His power is unfathomable but he could take you all out by himself... Trying to kill... the villagers he protects... is impossible for you." The scene before him proved the truth of those words. Nigun erased those words from his mind trying desperately to bring himself over. Nigun knew that the members of the strongest special ops group the Black Scripture could also eliminate this many angels. In other words all he had to do was treat Ainz as an opponent on their level. While he might be as strong as a member of the Black Scripture he had the advantage of numbers on his side so victory was still possible.
