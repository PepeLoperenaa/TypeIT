Momonga thought a bit more and looked at the gap in Albedo's flavor text. I should probably fill that up... "This feels a little silly." Although he was laughing at himself he still typed out a few words on the console keyboard. The words formed a sentence "She loves Momonga." "Uwah how embarrassing." Momonga covered his face with his palm. It felt as though he were designing his ideal girlfriend complete with love events for himself which embarrassed him so much that his heart began pounding. Although he wanted to rewrite it again out of shame in the end he changed his mind and decided against it. The game would end soon after all and his shame would vanish with it. Besides the sentence he added matched the gap left by the deleted sentence exactly. It would be a shame if he deleted it and left an empty space again. Momonga sat on the throne scanning his surroundings with eyes filled with satisfaction and a little embarrassment. He noticed that Sebas and the maids were still standing by in a dormant state. It seemed a little lonely and a little odd to have them standing motionless like that. I think there was a command for that. Momonga recalled the words he had heard before and extended a hand before lightly bringing it down. "Kneel." As one Albedo Sebas and the six maids fell to one knee in obeisance. Good. Momonga raised his left hand to check the time.
