"My sincerest apologies!" they said in unison. Momonga magnanimously accepted their apologies with a nod. Then, he turned and said, "Cocytus, you've come." "I. Came. Immediately. Upon. Receiving. Your. Summons. Momonga-sama." The water in the air froze with a crackling sound as it made contact with the white vapor puffing out of Cocytus' mouth as he spoke. This cold was every bit as frigid as the Primal Fire Elemental was hot. Anyone standing near him would suffer the effects of the lowered temperature, and they might even sustain frostbite. However, Momonga did not feel anything. The fact was that everyone here was resistant to fire, cold and acid attacks, or had some way to deal with them. "You must have been very free with no intruders around, no?" "Indeed." The clacking from his lower mandibles sounded like the threatening noises of a wasp. However, Momonga had the feeling that he was laughing. "Even. So. There. Are. Still. Things. Which. Must. Be. Done. So. I. Was. Not. Free. At. All." "Oh? Things that had to be done? What things were these, may I ask?" "Training. In. Order. To. Be. Ready. To. Deploy. At. Any. Time." Although it was not too obvious from his appearance, Cocytus was designed to be the quintessential warrior, be it in personality or body. Therefore, from the perspective of a weapon user, his attacks were the strongest in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. "You've done all this for me. You've worked hard. My thanks." "After. Hearing. Your. Praise. The. Task. Is. Not. As. Tiring. I. See. Demiurge. And. Albedo. Have. Arrived."
