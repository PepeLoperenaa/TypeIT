A lot of people would be averse to discussing reality in a virtual world. It was fairly normal for people to not want to talk about their offline lives in a game. However this was not so for the two of them. The guild they belonged to  a group that was founded and managed by players  Ainz Ooal Gown had two conditions that each of its members had to fulfil. The first was that everyone had to be a functioning part of society. The other was that they had to play heteromorphic characters. Because of these rules the topics they discussed often revolved around their jobs in the real world. Any member of the guild would field these questions and as such the conversation between the two could be considered standard fare for the guild. After about ten minutes the torrent of words that flowed from Herohero dwindled to a trickle. "...I'm sorry for making you listen to my whining. I can't complain much IRL." The place corresponding to Herohero's head seemed to sway as though he were bowing in apology. Thus Momonga replied "Don't worry about it Heroherosan. I made you come online despite you being busy so listening to your complaints is only expected. I'll hear you out no matter how many you have." Herohero seemed to have recovered some of his old energy and with a somewhat more energetic laugh he replied "Ah I'm grateful for that Momongasan. I'm glad I could meet a friend after signing on." "I'm very happy to hear you say that too." "...Although it's about time for me to log off." Herohero's tentacle waggled in midair as though he were operating something. Indeed he was operating a menu.
