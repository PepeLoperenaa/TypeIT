resources, and they had placed all sorts of monsters in their guild base in order to eliminate invading players. However, as of today, nobody was left. Of the 41 members of the guild, 37 of them had quit. The other three were still registered as members of the guild, but Momonga had already lost count of the number of days since they had last come here. Momonga opened a system console and connected to the developers' website to inspect the official guild rankings. Right now there were just under 800 guilds in YGGDRASIL. In the past, they had ranked as high as the 9th place, but now - as of the last day of the game - they were in the 29th place. At their lowest, they had fallen to 48th place. The reason why their ranking had not fallen even further was not because of Momonga's efforts, but because of the items left behind by his former comrades. One could call this a hollow shell of a guild, a relic of past glories. -This was the incarnation of those days. This was the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown.    He did not want to let this weapon and its memories of their golden days stay here to be a painful reminder of the past. Yet, contrary thoughts wormed their way through Momonga's heart. Ainz Ooal Gown had always decided things by use of a majority vote. Momonga might have been the guildmaster but his job was mainly communicating with people and other minor tasks. Because of that, now that there were no other guild members present, for the first time, Momonga thought to exercise his powers as the guild's leader. "This is a pretty sad state of affairs."
