OVERLORD VOLUME 1 CHAPTER 3 BATTLE OF CARNE VILLAGE Part 1 The dressing room which adjoined Momonga's suite was a chaotic mess of items with hardly any place to put one's feet. There were items like capes with which Momonga could equip himself and suits of full plate armor which he could not use at all. In addition to armor and other protectives there were weapons ranging from magic staves to great swords. This was truly an assortment of gear. Players could produce a nearly infinite variety of original magic items in YGGDRASIL. Defeated monsters dropped data crystals which formed a magic item when they were set into an item skin. Therefore people would immediately buy item skins that they liked. That was the reason for this room's state. Momonga picked out a greatsword from the weapons in the room. Freed from its sheath the silvery blade sparkled in the light. The runes carved into the blade's body sparkled as well etching themselves into any onlookers' eyes. Momonga swung the greatsword around. It was as light as a feather. Of course this was not because the blade was light but because Momonga was very strong. Momonga was a mage and his spellcasting stats were very high but his physical stats were lower in comparison. Still the strength he had gained from reaching level 100 was not an inconsiderable figure. If he encountered weak monsters he could easily pulverize them with his staff.
