 The crimson light of the setting sun shone on a group of men upon the plains. There were 45 of them. They must have had excellent camouflage techniques given the way they had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Magic was most likely involved. It was obvious at a glance that they were not simple mercenaries, travellers or adventurers. They were all dressed the same way, in armor made of special metals, which emphasised defensive power and mobility. After enchantment, they were more protective than full plate armor. The bags on their backs were small, hardly the kind one would expect a traveller to carry. Those bags were enchanted as well. Their belts were special, designed to carry potions, and the capes on their backs also radiated an aura of magic. Gathering this many sets of magic items would be a daunting task, be it in terms of time, money or effort required. The fact that these people were outfitted in this sort of equipment was a clear sign that they had the backing of a nation, or the equivalent. However, there were no markings or badges on them which might reveal their allegiance. In other words, they were hiding the fact that they were black ops unit. They looked at the ruins of the village with emotionless eyes. Although the stink of blood and fire hung heavy in the air, their merciless gazes seemed to say that this was only to be expected. "...They fled." The words were spoken with a hint of disappointment.
