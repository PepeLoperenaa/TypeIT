The first to enter Momonga's line of sight was a distinguished old gentleman in a butler's outfit. His hair was pure white, even the beard and moustache near his mouth. However, the old man's back was ramrod-straight, like a sword forged of steel. His face was deeply wrinkled and gave onlookers the impression that he was a kind and gentle person, but his keen eyes were like those of an eagle sizing up its prey. There were six maids standing behind the butler. However, these maids were different from the one Momonga had met earlier, in looks and equipment. The maids wore gauntlets and greaves of gold, silver, black and other colored metals. Their armor was designed to look like the outfits of maids in manga. They did not wear helmets, but instead white headpieces. In addition, every girl was armed with a different weapon. They were the picture of battle maids. Their hairstyles were also varied, with bunned-up hair, ponytails, long, straight hair, French curls, and so on. The one thing they had in common was that every single one of them was attractive. The exact way in which they were attractive also varied within them; one was sporty and athletic, one resembled a demure Japanese maiden, one of them had a seductive allure, and so on. These girls were NPCs, but they were strikingly different from the other maids, who had simply been designed for entertainment. Their purpose was to defend against invaders. In a game like YGGDRASIL, guilds enjoyed several benefits if they possessed a guild base of castle-tier or higher. One of these was NPCs for base defense. The NPCs that the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick could field were undead monsters. These automatically spawning NPCs - or "pop monsters"
