OVERLORD VOLUME 1 CHAPTER 4 CONFRONTATION Part 1 The village chief had a house near the village square. Upon entering, one would be greeted by a large living room, with a kitchen off to one side. A rickety old table and several chairs occupied the center of the room. Ainz surveyed the interior from where he was seated on one of the chairs. The sunlight which shone through the windows illuminated every corner of the room, so he could see clearly inside even without darkvision. He took a look at the woman in the corner of the kitchen, and the farming tools inside the house. There were no manufactured products to be seen anywhere. Just as Ainz thought that there would not be much in the way of technology here, Ainz realised that his thinking might be naive. Still, he was curious about what sort of science that a world with magic would develop. Ainz shifted his hand across the old table to avoid the sunlight. His metal gauntlets were not heavy, but the shabbily-made table shook under its weight. The chair also creaked from Ainz sitting on it. This was a textbook definition of the word "poverty". Ainz leaned the Staff on the table to keep it out of people's way. The way the Staff reflected the sunlight in a brilliant display made the run-down old house appear to be some sort of fairytale wonderland. He recalled the surprised expressions on the villager's faces, the way their eyes went wide and how they were lost for words.
