"Indeed Your fear is only natural. After all this is what an angel of the highest order looks like. While using it here seems like a bit of a waste I have determined that you are worthy of it" "How could this be..." Ainz slowly raised his hand and covered his face. To Nigun it looked like a gesture of despair. "Ainz Ooal Gown. The truth is you deserve respect for forcing me to summon this most exalted of angels. Be proud of your fearsome strength magic caster" Nigun nodded deeply and continued "Personally speaking I would like to bring you into our fold. If you are truly that powerful... however I am not allowed to do so on this mission. At the very least I shall remember you  the magic caster who made me decide to summon this mighty angel." However the response to Nigun's praise was a cold voice "Really... this is ridiculous." "What" Nigun had no idea what Ainz was saying. To Nigun Ainz was little more than a sacrifice to the highest order of angel which humanity could not possibly defeat. Yet his attitude seemed too relaxed for that. "I can't believe I was on guard against such child's play... my apologies Albedo. I made you use your skill for nothing."
