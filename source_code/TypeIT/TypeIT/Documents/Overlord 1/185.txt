After grumbling in his heart Momonga looked back to the mirror. Momonga's plan was to teach Demiurge the hardlearned lessons of how to control the magic mirror. This was what Momonga had meant when he spoke to Demiurge about another security net. Although it would have been simpler to leave this task to his subordinates Momonga wanted to handle this task personally. The truth was that he wanted to use his cando working attitude to inspire and gain the respect of his subordinates. Therefore he could not be seen to give up halfway. Still why can't I switch to a higher vantage point If only there were a manual... With these thoughts in mind Momonga went about the painstaking work of figuring the mirror's controls out by boring repetitive trial and error. He did not know how long it had been. It might have only been a while but so far his work had not borne fruit and he could not help but feel like this was all a waste of time. Momonga casually waved his hand with a vacant expression and his field of vision suddenly expanded. "Oh" Surprise delight pride Momonga's exclamation was filled with all of these. At his wits' end he made a random gesture and the screen suddenly did as he wanted. This was a cry of joy one would expect out of a programmer who had pulled eight hours' worth of overtime. Cheering and clapping answered him. The source of these two sounds was Sebas. "Congratulations Momongasama. Your servant Sebas stands in awe of your prowess." Granted this was the fruit of extensive trial and error so you don't need to go that far. Momonga thought that but when he saw that Sebas looked quite happy he decided to humbly accept the butler's praise.
