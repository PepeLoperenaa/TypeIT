His brain finally managed to make sense of Albedo's words. Although whether there really was a brain under that skull remained to be seen. As Momonga realized why Albedo had this reaction an immense struggle took place within himself before he finally said "Enough that's all for now Albedo." "Eh I understand." "Now is not the time for... no there's no time for that sort of thing." "My my apologies I allowed myself to be ruled by my desires despite the urgency of the situation" With a swift movement Albedo made to genuflect in apology but Momonga stopped her "No all this is my fault. I forgive you Albedo. But other than this... I have an order." "Please give me any command you desire." "Tell the Guardians of each Floor with the exception of the 4th and the 8th Floors to meet at the Colosseum on the 6th Floor in an hour's time. I will contact Aura and Mare myself so there is no need to inform them." "Understood. Allow me to repeat the order aside from Aura and Mare of the 6th Floor I am to inform all the Floor Guardians to meet one hour later at the Colosseum." "Correct. Go." "Yes." Albedo swiftly departed the Throne Room.
