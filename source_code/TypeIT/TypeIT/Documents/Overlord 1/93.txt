Momonga's insistence was so great that even the dubious Aura went ahead with it. Given that they were no longer in the game, there was a possibility he could not ignore, which was that Aura's skill might not have activated properly. In order to rule that out, he had to expose himself to the skill with a third party, which was why he had summoned the Moonlight Wolves. After that, Aura exhaled several times, but Momonga did not feel affected in any way. He tried relaxing or turning around in the middle of the skill, but he felt nothing strange. However, the Moonlight Wolf behind him was affected. Thus, he concluded that Aura's skill had taken effect. From this experiment, Momonga learned that mind-affecting effects did not work on him. This meant- In the game, demihuman and heteromorphic races unlocked racial skills when they reached certain levels. An Overlord like Momonga had the following skills: Create High-Tier Undead 4 times/day, Create Mid-Tier Undead 12 times/day, Create Low-Tier Undead 20 times/day, Negative Energy Touch, Despair Aura V (instant death), Negative Protection, Dark Soul, Black Halo, Undead Blessing, Unholy Protection, Wisdom of Darkness, Speak Evil Tongues, Ability Damage IV, Piercing Damage Resistance V, Slashing Damage Resistance V, Turn Resistance III, High-Tier Physical Immunity III, High-Tier Magic Immunity III, Cold, Acid and Electrical Immunity, as well as Arcane Vision/See Invisibility. And then there were the abilities from his class levels - Instant Death Magic Enhancement, Rite of Darkness, Undead Aura, undead creation, undead control, undead strengthening, and so on. Then there were the basic special qualities which all undead possessed: Immunity to critical hits, mind-affecting, poison, disease, sleep, paralysis, death and energy drain effects. Resistance to necromancy and biological penalties. Undead did not need to breathe, eat or drink. They were healed by negative energy and had darkvision.
