"Oh WarriorCaptaindono I'm glad you're alright. I should have gone to your side earlier but the item I gave you took some time to work which was why I was almost too late. My apologies." "What are you saying It is I who should thank you Gowndono. After all you saved me... speaking of which where did those fellows go" Since Gazef had changed his tone somewhat Ainz decided to nonchalantly inspect him. Gazef had taken off his armor and carried no weapons with him. He was bruised all over and half his face was swollen up like a strangelooking misshapen ball. Yet a fire burned within his eyes. Ainz turned away as though he had seen something brilliant. His eyes reflexively went to the ring Gazef wore on his left ring finger. So he was married. It's probably good that his wife won't need to shed tears for him. As he thought about that Ainz decided to carefully put on an act "Oh I chased them off. I couldn't take care of all of them as I thought." That was a lie of course. They had all been shipped back to the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. Gazef narrowed his eyes a little but neither of them spoke. The air between them grew tense. In the end Gazef broke the silence "Truly amazing. I do not know how I can repay you for your help Gowndono. Please look for me when you come to the Royal Capital. I will welcome you with open arms."
