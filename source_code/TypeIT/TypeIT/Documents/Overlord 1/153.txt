fatigue. There might have been something resembling lust but he had felt no excitement even when he was caressing Albedo's soft breasts. A terrible sense of loss filled Momonga and he instinctively glanced down to his waist. "Could it be... it vanished because I never used it" However his small voice and the sense of loss vanished as he spoke. Therefore Momonga concluded that these changes in particular the mental changes were part of the undead immunity to mindaffecting effects. Right now he possessed an undead body and mind but there were some remnants of his humanity left. Therefore even when he experienced emotions if they surged to a peak they would be immediately suppressed. If he continued on like this he might end up losing all his emotions in the future. Of course even if that happened it would hardly be a big deal because no matter how this world turned out or what happened to his body his will was still his own. In addition the NPCs like Shalltear and so on would be by his side. Perhaps worrying about becoming undead was premature. "Create Greater Item" Once Momonga cast the spell his body was sheathed in a suit of engraved full plate armor. It glowed darkly and its surface was covered in gold and silver patterns. It looked very expensive. He moved around in it to see how it felt. Although it was somewhat restrictive he was not immobilized. In addition the armor fit his body very well which was quite unexpected considering the gaps between his bareboned body and the armor. It would seem that he could use magicgenerated items just like in YGGDRASIL.
