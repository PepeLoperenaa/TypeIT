Nigun said that but he was very clear that another mission of this nature would be very unlikely. The orders he had been given were to "assassinate the greatest warrior of the Kingdom the man famed in the surrounding countries for his matchless might Gazef Stronoff." This was not the sort of task which would usually be assigned to the Sunlight Scripture. Instead it would have been the province of the Theocracy's most powerful special operations unit the Black Scripture whose members wielded the power of heroes. However it was not possible this time round. The reason was top secret so he could not tell his subordinates but Nigun knew the truth. The Black Scripture was protecting the holy relic "Kei Seke Kouku" in preparation against the resurrection of the Catastrophe Dragon Lord while the Windflower Scripture was busy chasing the traitor who had made off with a relic of the Miko Princesses. Neither of them had the free time to help them. Nigun unconsciously felt the scar on his cheek. He remembered the only time in the past where he had forced to flee with his tail between his legs. The face of that girl with the jetblack demonic sword rose in his mind. Magic could have easily healed the wound without leaving a mark but he had purposely left the scar to engrave the lesson of that humiliating defeat into his heart. "...That damnable Blue Rose." The members of Blue Rose were citizens of the Kingdom just like Gazef. Their priestess was the one who most drew his ire. Besides the fact that she was an infidel who worshipped another god she had stopped Nigun while he was planning to attack demihumans and even believed that she was on the side of justice in doing so.
