He could easily defeat an angel with those techniques. But even if he struck them down, more of them were summoned anew. As long as he did not defeat their summoners, they would call up more angels to face him. While trying to run the opposition out of mana was an option, Gazef would probably tire before that. The truth was, Gazef's arms were growing heavier and heavier, and his heart was racing. [Instant Counter] was a martial art that forcibly corrected the body's balance after making an attack, resetting it to before the blow was struck. While that meant that the practitioner could immediately attack again, the forced reset of the body would place immense strain on it. [Flow Acceleration] was a martial art that increased the speed at which one's nerves functioned, increasing one's attack rate. However, that technique created fatigue in the brain. And then, there was the ultimate attack, the [Sixfold Slash of Light]. Using them put a great burden on the body, but without them, he would have no chance at all. "Bring them all on! Your angels are nothing!" His fearsome shout startled the Theocracy troops, but they soon recovered and renewed the offensive on Gazef. "Pay him no heed, that's just the roar of a caged beast. Don't worry, deplete his strength bit by bit. But don't get too close. That beast's claws are long and sharp." Gazef glared at the man with a scar on his face. If only he could defeat him, he could turn the battle around. The problem was the other angel near him, different from the ones with the flaming swords. And then there was the great distance between them, and the several layers of defenses in the way.
