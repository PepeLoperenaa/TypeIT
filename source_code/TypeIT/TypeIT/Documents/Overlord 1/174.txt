"Mare I am pleased with your loyalty. At the same time I understand your reluctance as an NPC to accept this ring which symbolizes us. However if you truly understand my intentions you will accept my orders and this ring with them." "But but why me... shouldn't everyone else have gotten one too..." "I had intended to give the others these rings however you are the first. This is because I am pleased with your work. If I gave this to someone who did no work then this ring would have no meaning. Or do you intend to devalue this ring" "No no of course not" "Then take it Mare. After accepting this ring continue working hard for Nazarick and myself." Mare nervously reached out his hand and slowly accepted the ring. Momonga felt somewhat guilty as he watched Mare. The truth was that he had an ulterior motive for giving him the ring. That was because once Mare had the ring it would be more difficult for people to tell that Momonga was teleporting around. As Mare put on the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown it immediately changed its dimensions to fit Mare's slender fingers. He could not help but stare at the ring on his finger sighing in relief. Then he turned to Momonga and bowed deeply. "Momongasama ththank you for this great gift... I promise that from today onward I will work harder so I do not disappoint you" "Then I'll trust you with it Mare." "Yes" A determined look appeared on Mare's face as he gave his immediate answer.
