"Fly."  Freed from the shackles of gravity Momonga floated lightly into the sky. He rose upward in a straight line gaining speed as he did. Although Demiurge was frantically trying to catch up Momonga paid him no heed and ascended steadily. Before he knew it he was several hundred meters in the air. Only then did Momonga's body slow down. He forcefully cast aside his helmet and said nothing  no as he looked down at this world he could not say anything. The bluewhite light of the moon and stars chased away the darkness of the land. The grasslands ruffled by a gentle wind seemed to be glowing. The countless stars and the moon gave off their own radiance as well shining brilliantly against the light coming from the earth. Momonga could not help but sigh "This is beautiful... no beautiful would not begin to describe this... what would Blue Planetsan say if he were here" What would he do if he saw this world whose air land and water had not been polluted Momonga recalled his comrade from the past the man who had showed up for the guild's offline meetings whose stony face had broken out into a delicate smile when he was praised as a romantic  that gentle man who loved the night sky. No he loved nature which had been polluted and almost completely destroyed. He played YGGDRASIL because he appreciated those scenes which no longer existed in reality. He had built the 6th Floor with his sweat blood and tears. Its night sky was his personal design and it was a reproduction of the idealized world in his heart.
