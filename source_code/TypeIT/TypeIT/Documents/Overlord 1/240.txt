had to kidnap someone and make him talk about what he knew? That was not a very workable option. That being the case, there was only one alternative left to him. "...It would seem I will need to live in a city for a while." He had to observe and imitate many things in order to learn about the world. He also needed to understand the magic of this world, and many other things about it. As he thought about this, he heard footsteps from outside the flimsy wooden door. There was a large delay between the sounds of the footsteps, which meant that whoever it was, they were not advancing quickly. Those were the steady, plodding sounds of a grown man's footsteps. A knocking came from the door just as Ainz turned to it. The chief could not help but look at Ainz's face. He dared not act of his own accord because he was still explaining things to his savior, as payment for saving him and everyone else in the village. "Please, by all means. I was intending to take a break myself. I won't mind if you step outside." "I'm very sorry about this," the chief said as he nodded in apology. He headed to the door, and when he opened it, a villager appeared. He looked first to the chief, then to Ainz, and said: "Chief, I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're talking to our guests, but they're ready for the burial..." "Oh..." The chief looked to Ainz, his eyes begging for his approval. "It's fine. There's no need to worry about me." "Thank you. Then, tell the others that I will be there soon."
