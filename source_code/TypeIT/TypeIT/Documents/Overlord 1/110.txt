The first party he tried to contact was a GM. In YGGDRASIL, when one used the [Message] spell, as long as the other party was within the game, one would hear a call tone. Otherwise, there would be no sound, and the spell would immediately terminate. What happened now was somewhere between both of those. It felt like something was constantly reaching out, as though looking for something to connect to. This was the first time Momonga had experienced something like this and it was difficult to describe. This feeling continued for a while, and in the end, after failing to connect, the [Message] spell ended. A profound sense of disappointment flooded through him. Momonga tried casting the same spell again. This time, he did not choose a GM. This time, he picked one of his comrades from the past - a member of Ainz Ooal Gown. He cast the spell, though his heart was filled with one part of hope and ninetynine parts of resignation. As expected, there was no response. He tried to contact the 40, no, 41 members of the Guild with a [Message], but after receiving no reply, Momonga gently shook his head. In truth, he had expected this outcome and had resigned himself to it, but actually being confronted by that fact filled him with an incomparable feeling of despair. In the end, Momonga decided to contact Sebas. -It connected. This proved that the [Message] spell was working, and that most likely, it could only contact people within this new world. "Momonga-sama."
