If the buckets were bigger I could make fewer trips wouldn't that make things easier Then again if the buckets were bigger I probably wouldn't be able to lift them... As Enri thought about that issue on her way back home she heard a sound and turned to look at it. There was tension in the air over there and the seeds of fear began sprouting in her heart. Her ears seemed to pick up something like wood being broken and after that "A scream" It sounded like a strangled bird but it was definitely not a bird's call. A chill ran down Enri's spine. Unbelievable. There must be some kind of mistake. It couldn't be a human's voice. She tried to erase her unease with these thoughts and then they vanished. She had to run to the source of the scream because it was coming from the direction of her home. Enri cast aside the water buckets. She could not run while carrying that heavy burden. Although she nearly tripped over her long skirt she managed to keep her balance by some stroke of luck. The sound rang through the air once more. Enri's heart lurched in her chest. There was no mistake about it  it was a human scream. She ran and ran and ran. Enri could not recall going faster than this in her life. She was running so fast that her legs were about to tangle each other up.
