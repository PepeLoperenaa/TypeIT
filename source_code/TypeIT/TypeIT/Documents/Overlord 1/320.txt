"Is that so... then I will have to impose on you when the time comes." "...Gowndono I do not know what plans you have but would you be willing to travel with us We will be staying in this village for a while." "Is that so. Well I was planning to move on though I have not decided my destination yet." "Still it's already so late travelling now would be..." Gazef cut himself off halfway "Forgive me there was no need to worry about a mighty being like yourself Gowndono. Then please seek me out when you reach the capital. My doors will always be open to you. In addition I am deeply grateful to you for your gift of a full set of equipment from the knights who attacked the village." Ainz nodded and decided that he had taken care of everything he needed to do in this village. There had been more things to do here than he had expected and he had spent more time here than he had planned. "Let's go home Albedo" Ainz said in a voice low enough that only Albedo could here. She immediately turned around joyfully in response  although she was still wearing her full plate armor.
