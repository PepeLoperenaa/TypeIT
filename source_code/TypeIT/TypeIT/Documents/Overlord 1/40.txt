She was the Overseer of the Floor Guardians of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick Albedo. She was in charge of the seven NPC Floor Guardians. In other words she was the highestranked character in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. Because of that she was permitted to await orders within the Throne Room in the deepest reaches of the Tomb. However Momonga turned a sharp look on Albedo "I knew there was a WorldClass Item here but how is it that there are two of them here now" In YGGDRASIL there were 200 ultimate items in the game known as WorldClass Items. WorldClass Items possessed unique abilities and some of them were so balancebreaking that they could even request changes in the game's rules from the developers. Of course not every WorldClass Item possessed such insane power. Even so a player who possessed even a single WorldClass Item would be catapulted to the highest echelons of fame in YGGDRASIL. Ainz Ooal Gown possessed 11 items like this the most of any guild. Even that was far in excess of any other guild. The guild in second place only possessed three such items. With the permission of the other guild members Momonga was allowed to possess one of these ultimate items and the rest of these WorldClass Items were scattered throughout Nazarick. However most of them were stored in the depths of the Treasury defended by its Avataras. The only reason why Albedo could possess such a rare treasure like this without Momonga's knowledge was because the guild member who designed Albedo had given it to her.
