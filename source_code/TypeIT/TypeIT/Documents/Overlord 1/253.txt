"Offer up your faith to the gods." Everyone began their silent prayers, a shortened version of their usual praise to their gods. They had to spend time in prayer even when operating in another country. This was not complacency on their part, but a symbol of their faith in their gods. These men who offered everything to the Slaine Theocracy and the gods they revered were far more devout than the average citizen of the Theocracy.

However, there were very few of these men, who were the most involved of the Six Scriptures in combat. There were only around a hundred of them in total.
