The sigil on the flag represented "Momonga". "I have changed my name. From now on, my name is..." Ainz pointed to a certain place, and everyone's eyes followed his finger. "My name is Ainz Ooal Gown. You may address me as Ainz." Momonga was pointing to the flag which hung behind the throne, imprinted with the icon of Ainz Ooal Gown. Momonga raised his staff and forcefully slammed its tip into the ground, to get everybody's attention. "If anyone objects to this, rise now and let your views be heard!" Nobody spoke out in opposition. Albedo was all smiles as she replied: "We have all heard your glorious name. All hail Ainz Ooal Gown! Oh Supreme One, Ainz Ooal Gown-sama, every member of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick pledges their undying loyalty to you." Shortly after, the Floor Guardians shouted as one: "All glory to Ainz Ooal Gown! Supreme Lord and leader of us all, Ainz Ooal Gown-sama! We shall give ourselves completely to you!" "Long live Ainz Ooal Gown! Oh King of fearsome power, Ainz Ooal Gown-sama! All shall know of your greatness!"
