If he just wanted to scrape by he could simply live in the mountains like a beast. However the power he possessed and the mighty name he bore prevented him from doing that. If he wanted was to coexist peacefully with the world then he would need to deal with problems as and when they came up. As such combat and the expansion of fighting power would become a very important topic in future. He had to gather information about this world as well as news about other players. "...That should do." "What happened" "No it's nothing. I simply spaced out because things were not as I expected. Right can you tell me about something else now" "Ah ah yes I understand."  The village chief started talking about monsters next. Much like YGGDRASIL this world had monsters in it. The nearby forest was filled with monsters and one of them was known as the "Wise King of the Forest". There were also Dwarves all sorts of Elves Goblins Orcs Ogres and the like. Apparently some of the demihumans had even built their own nation. There were people called adventurers who drove off these monsters and they counted many magic casters among their number. Apparently these adventurers had guilds of their own in all the big cities. Apart from that he also learned about the nearby fortress city of ERantel. According to the chief ERantel was the biggest city in the area although he did not know exactly how large its population was. That seemed to be the best place to gather information.
