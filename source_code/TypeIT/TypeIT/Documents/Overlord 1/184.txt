Momonga enjoyed the movielike quality of the grass within the mirror as the image changed. "It would seem that I can move the image with a wave of the hand. That way I won't have to keep looking at the same spot." The scenery and the angles with which it was viewed changed within the floating mirror. Although he had made several mistakes so far Momonga kept changing his gestures to alter the landscape within the mirror hoping that he would find someone. However up till now he had not found any intelligent beings  for instance humans. He repeated the same simple gestures over and over again but all the images he got were the same plains. Momonga was starting to get bored so he looked at the other person in the room. "What's wrong Momongasama I stand ready to heed your every command." "No there's nothing Sebas." Sebas was the other person in the room. He might have been smiling but his words seemed to hold some kind of subtext. Although Sebas was absolutely loyal to him he had objected to Momonga's excursion to the surface without bringing his followers along. Indeed just after Momonga returned from the surface Sebas had accosted and lectured him. Momonga said what was on his heart. "What will I do with him..." Being with Sebas made Momonga think of his guildmate Touch Me. After all Touch Mesan was the one who had designed Sebas. Still he didn't have to make him so similar to himself. Even the way Sebas gets angry reminds me of him.
