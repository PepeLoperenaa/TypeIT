"Leave the WarriorCaptain be for now. It is more important that we build a good relationship with that village. We might need their help in future so avoid antagonizing them." "Understood. I will take care of it. Thus ends the report." Ainz turned to look at Albedo as he said "Well done". The look on her face was slightly different from her usual gentle smile. She seemed particularly happy today. The reason was the sparkling Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown upon her left ring finger which she caressed lovingly. Although she could wear the ring anywhere she wanted it was not hard to tell why she was wearing the ring on that finger. If that was how Albedo truly felt then as a man he would be overjoyed. However if that was the result of Ainz's tampering it would make him feel guilty instead. "Albedo... the love you feel for me is the result of my tampering. They are certainly not your original feelings. Therefore..." What should he do next Was it right to change her memories with magic Ainz could not go on. Just then Albedo looked at Ainz and smiled. "Before you changed me what kind of person was I Ainzsama" A slut.
