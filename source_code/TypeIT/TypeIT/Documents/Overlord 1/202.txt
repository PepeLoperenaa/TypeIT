the air. He had originally planned to use an antimagic spell as well but he did not know what sort of magic existed in this world so he did not do so for the time being. If the enemy had magic casters then that was just their bad luck. "I have cast a defensive spell that keeps living creatures from coming near you as well as a spell that weakens the effectiveness of shooting attacks. As long as you stay here you should be safe. Ah just in case I will give you these as well." After calmly explaining the effects of the magic to the two dumbfounded sisters Momonga withdrew a pair of unremarkablelooking horns. Apparently the magic did not obstruct them since they sailed straight through the forcefield as Momonga tossed them to the sisters' side. "These are called the Horns of the Goblin General. If you blow them Goblins  in other words small monsters  will appear. Order them to protect you." In YGGDRASIL electronic data crystals dropped from monsters could be slotted into almost any sort of item apart from certain expendable items in order to create just about any item a player could think of. In addition there were certain artifacts which could not be created by players and had fixed stats. These horns were examples of them. Momonga had used the horn before and at that time it managed to summon a Goblin Troop 12 or so Goblins with some measure of ability. There were two Goblin Archers one Goblin Mage a Goblin Cleric two Goblin Riders and their wolf mounts as well as one Goblin Leader. Although it was called a Goblin Troop their numbers were few and they were very weak. This was a trash item for Momonga. The surprise was why he had not disposed of it yet. Still Momonga felt quite smart for being able to put this trash item to good use. Another good point about this item was that the summoned Goblins would linger until they were killed instead of vanishing after a while. That could at least buy the girls some time.
