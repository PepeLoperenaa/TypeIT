Momonga spoke the name of the Dark Elf child. He was addressing the Guardian of the 6th Floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, Aura Bella Fiora. She was a skirmisher who was also able to summon and tame beasts. Aura jogged over to Momonga. Well, to her, it was a jogging pace, but she was travelling as fast as one of his beasts at full speed, rapidly closing the distance between them. Aura screeched to a halt. Her running shoes had hihiirokane metal plates on the soles, and they threw up clouds of dust as they ground against the floor of the arena. The clouds did not touch Momonga's body; if she had planned that, then his skills must have been impressive indeed. "Huu" Aura was not sweating, but yet she wiped her forehead theatrically. Then, with a puppy-like smile, she greeted Momonga. "Welcome, Momonga-sama. Welcome to the level I guard!" The greeting was filled with the same respect that Albedo, Sebas and the maids had for him, but for some reason it felt more intimate. To Momonga, this intimacy allowed him to loosen up. Being too uptight and scary was quite troublesome for Momonga, who was not experienced with this sort of thing. He could not detect any hostility on Aura's face, and his [Enemy Scan] revealed nothing. Momonga's line of sight left the band on his right wrist and he loosened his grip on the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. He had planned to strike hard and fade away if an emergency occurred, but it seemed as though there would be no need for that. "...Mm. I'll be intruding for a while."
