When the bell in the middle of the village - the village square - rang to signal noon, everyone would break for lunch. Lunch would be black bread baked several days before, as well as soup with some shredded meat jerky sprinkled in. Field work would resume after lunch, and when the sun set they would return home for dinner. For dinner, they would have the same black bread that they had for lunch, as well as bean soup. If the village's hunters managed to bag any prey, they might be able to get some meat to go with their dinner. After dinner, the family would gather around the light of the hearth-fire to take care of household chores, such as mending worn or damaged clothes. They would go to sleep around 8. The girl Enri Emmot was born 16 years ago and had become a part of the village since then. She had lived these days all her life. In her heart, she wondered: how much longer will these unchanging days continue? Today was no different from any other. After waking up, Enri went to the well to carry water. After filling her buckets at the well, she would need three trips to fill the house's water tank. "Yosh" Enri rolled up her sleeves, exposing her untanned skin, which was pale and stood out. Long years of farm life ensured that although her arms looked slender and frail, they were actually very strong, with just a hint of muscle on them. The filled buckets were very heavy, but Enri hoisted them up like she always did.
