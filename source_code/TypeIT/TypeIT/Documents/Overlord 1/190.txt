"I will repay that debt... besides, sooner or later, I'll have to test my fighting strength in this world." After saying that to his absent friend, Momonga enlarged the view of the village until he saw everything. After that, he tried to pick out the surviving villagers. "Sebas, put Nazarick on maximum alert. I will go first, and you will tell Albedo, who is standing by next door, to follow me after fully equipping herself. However, I forbid her to bring Ginnungagap. After that, prepare support units. Something might happen which results in my inability to retreat. Therefore the units sent to the village should be adept at stealth or have the ability to go invisible." "I understand, but I wish to request the task of defending your body to be given to me." "Then who will relay my orders? These knights are currently sacking the village, which means there might be knights near Nazarick who might attack us. Therefore, you must stay." The image changed, and now it showed a girl sending a knight flying with a punch. The girl was leading an even younger girl as they ran away. They were probably sisters. Momonga immediately opened his inventory and withdrew the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. Just as the girl planned to flee, she was slashed in the back. Since time was tight, Momonga swiftly incanted the spell. "[Gate]." It had no limits on distance and a 0% chance of teleport mishaps. The spell Momonga used was the most accurate and potent of such spells in YGGDRASIL. The scene before him changed in an instant.
