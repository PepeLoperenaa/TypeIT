"This is currency used in a land far far away. Can it be used here" "I should think so... please wait a little." Relief came over Ainz as he heard that the coin could be used. Then he watched as the chief left his seat went to his room and came back with something he had once seen during his history lessons. That object was called a balance scale. After that it was his wife's turn. She took the gold coin and put it next to a circular object as though she were comparing their sizes. After she was satisfied she placed the gold coin on one pan of the balance and on the other pan went a counterweight. He seemed to recall that this sort of thing was called a "standardized mass". As Ainz went through his memories he compared them to the wife's actions and tried to figure out what she was trying to do. The first part should have been comparing his coin to the gold pieces of this country and next she was trying to confirm its gold content. It would seem the gold coin was heavier and the standardized mass rose up. The chief's wife put another mass on it and both sides balanced out. "It seems to be about twice as heavy as a regular gold piece... perhaps perhaps if we could scratch the surface..." "Ooi You're being rude Please accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of my wife for saying such foolish things..." No wonder. She must have thought it was goldplated. Ainz was not completely unoffended but he was not angry. "It's fine... although if you scratch it and find that it's pure gold you'll take it no" "Ah no... we are truly sorry for this."
