Almost all of the guild's NPCs were gathered below him. They looked quite majestic when he watched them from on high like a Night Parade of monsters. Ainz could not help but silently praise his guild members for their creativity in making so many different and interesting characters. As he looked again there were several NPCs who were not present. However that could not be helped. After all they could not easily move the ultralarge golem Gargantua and Victim  who oversaw the 8th Floor  from their positions. However it was not just NPCs who were gathered here. Although they were not intended to replace the abovementioned two people this great hall also contained many highlevelled vassals who had been handpicked by the other Floor Guardians. That said  the Throne Room did not feel crowded at all given its massive size. Although he could understand why his underlings would not want to let their servants into the heart of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick  the Throne Room  Ainz felt that such severity was not needed. Ah forget it not like it's important anyway. After deciding to discuss those matters later Ainz slowly addressed his subordinates. "Firstly I would like to apologize for taking independent action." Ainz was feeling singularly unapologetic as he said those words. It was mere pleasantry yet the apology was extremely important. Since gathering them all was his idea then he needed to let his subordinates know that he trusted them implicitly. "Albedo will tell you why I have gathered you all here afterwards. However there is a matter which is more important than that. I must tell the gathered members of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick something  Greater Break Item."  Ainz cast a spell which could destroy a magic item of a certain level. A large flag fell from one of the poles attached to the ceiling.
