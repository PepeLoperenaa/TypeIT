A sudden spike of cold pierced his spine followed by a surge of nausea. Nigun the hardened killer who had presided over many slaughters was now feeling something that he had never felt before. He had to run. He had no way of beating Ainz so doing battle with him would be very dangerous. However Nigun struggled to shake that feeling away. He had cornered his prey Gazef  how could he watch him get away now Still a warning resonated from the depths of his soul. Nigun shouted his order "All angels attack Hurry" Every one of the Archangel Flames shot toward Ainz like bullets. "What a lively lot... Albedo step back." Nigun could hear the cool calm voice of someone who was being attacked by angels but did not care. Ainz was surrounded by so many angels that nobody could even see him but yet his voice did not carry even the slightest hint of worry. It looked like he would be impaled by countless blades  no Ainz's spell took effect before that. "Negative Burst."  The air shuddered.
