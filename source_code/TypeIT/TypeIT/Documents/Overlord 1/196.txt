Its massive body was sheathed in a suit of full plate armor made from some black armor and it was covered in red tracery that resembled blood vessels. The armor was also covered in spikes as far as anyone could see and it looked like a manshaped incarnation of brutality. Demonic horns sprang from its head and one could see its rotted face underneath them. Twin points of hateful murderous light shone in the eye sockets of its ghastly visage. Its tattered black cape blowing in the wind the Death Knight awaited Momonga's orders. The way it carried itself was truly deserving of the name "Death Knight". Much like he had with the Primal Fire Elemental and Moonlight Wolves he had summoned Momonga used the mental bond with his summoned monster and pointed to the corpse of the knight who had been slain by the Dragon Lightning. "Exterminate all the knights who are attacking this village." "OOOOOOOAAAAHHHHHHH" it roared. So mighty was its cry that it shook the air and it was so filled with bloodlust that everyone who heard it broke out in goosebumps. The Death Knight ran fast as lightning. The way it charged forward without hesitation was like a hunting hound that had scented its quarry. The undead hatred for the living made it sensitive to the prey that it would soon slaughter. As the Death Knight's silhouette shrank into the distance Momonga was keenly aware of a difference between this new world and YGGDRASIL. That was "independence". Originally the Death Knight should have stayed by its summoner's side to await his orders and attack any enemies which approached. Yet it had disregarded that order and launched an attack of its own accord. This difference might be a fatal vulnerability in an unknown situation like this one. At a loss for words Momonga scratched his head and sighed.
