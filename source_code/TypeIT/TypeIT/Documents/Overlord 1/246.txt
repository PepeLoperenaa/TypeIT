Albedo's reply sounded very tense. There should be no reason for her to be so on edge in a harmless place like the village. In that case, there was only one reason he could think of for Albedo to be like this. Ainz quietly asked Albedo: "...Do you hate humans?" "I detest them. Humans are weak and inferior lifeforms. They would look so pretty if I squashed them like bugs... besides that girl." Albedo's words were as sweet as honey, yet their meaning was terribly cruel. Ainz felt that they did not fit Albedo's benign, goddess-like beauty. Therefore, he said: "I see... I understand how you feel. However, I hope you can control yourself for the time being, because we have to put on a show." Albedo nodded energetically. As Ainz looked at her, he began to feel frustrated. Her likes or dislikes would not be a problem for now, but the future was a different matter. Understanding his subordinates was an important skill he had to master. After Ainz realized this, he began looking for the village chief. it was basic manners to bid someone farewell before leaving. He found the chief almost immediately, talking to some of the villagers. He had a stern look on his face, but it did not seem normal. Indeed, he seemed to be quite wound up. What was happening now? Ainz resisted the urge to go "Cheh" and approached the chief. After all, he had saved them once; that meant that they were his responsibility.
