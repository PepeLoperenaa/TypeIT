"...Please forgive my inability to answer the Supreme One's questions about this 'GM Call'. I apologize for not meeting your expectations. Nothing would please me more than a chance to make up for my prior mistake. Please, command me as you see fit." ...The two of them were conversing. There was no doubt about that. Learning this fact shocked Momonga so greatly that he could not speak. Impossible. This should have been impossible. The closest thing NPCs could come to conversations was with macroed responses to being addressed in a certain way. There was audio data for roars and cheering for players to download, but actually allowing an NPC to engage in conversation was an impossible task. Even Sebas from just now could only accept simple orders. Why had such an impossible event occurred? Was this phenomenon limited to Albedo? Momonga dismissed Albedo with a wave of the hand, and disappointment flashed across her face as she retreated. Momonga turned his eyes from her body to the butler and the six maids, whose heads were still lowered. "Sebas! Maids!" "Yes!" Their voices chorused out as one, and then the butler and maids raised their heads. "Approach the throne." "Understood." They responded as one, and then rose to their feet. After that, they proudly strode to the front of the throne before dropping to one knee and lowering their heads again.
