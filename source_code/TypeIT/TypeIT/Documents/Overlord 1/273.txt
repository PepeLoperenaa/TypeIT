Although his ultimate attack made his arms cramp up it was not enough to decrease his fighting effectiveness. Then as though ordered to drown out the cheers a huge wave of angels swept in and one of them lunged at Gazef with its flaming sword. "Instant Counter" Gazef used his martial art just as the angel swung and his body blurred away like mist. Halfway through its attack the angel took a hit from Gazef. That hit reduced it to glittering dust. But Gazef's offensive did not end there. "Flow Acceleration" With fluid graceful moves he dispatched the angels one after the other. His ultimate attack took down two more angels again. This splendid display of martial technique inspired Gazef's men and gave them a ray of hope. But the Theocracy's troops would not allow that to happen and their commander erased that hope with mockery. "Well done. However... that is all you can do. Clerics who have lost your angels summon new ones. Focus your spells on Stronoff" The heat which had been building in the air immediately cooled off. "This is bad." Gazef took down another angel as he muttered to himself. It would seem there would not be any more cheering no matter how many angels Gazef slew since his men were worrying about the enemy coming at them. They were superior in numbers equipment training and individual ability.
