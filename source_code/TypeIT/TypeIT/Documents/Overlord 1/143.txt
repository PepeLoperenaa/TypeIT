There was nothing which could delight them more than the master who created them the master to whom they owed their utmost loyalty revealing his true face to them. The Guardians no every entity created by the Supreme Beings wanted nothing more than to aid their creators in some way. The next best thing would be to receive their trust and to be treated as useful servants. This was a simple natural truth. This was the greatest joy in life for these characters who were created to aid the Supreme Beings. Then as though to wipe away this jubilant atmosphere Sebas said from the side "Then I shall take my leave first. I do not know where Momongasama has gone but I should stay by his side." Jealousy was written all over Albedo's face but she quashed her feelings and replied "I understand. Then Sebas serve Momongasama well and do not disgrace him. Report to me if anything happens. In particular if Momongasama summons me you must let me know immediately. Everything else is of secondary importance to that" A pained expression crossed Demiurge's face as he listened quietly from the side. "But if he desires me in his bedchamber you must inform Momongasama that I might be a while in order to bathe and cleanse myself for him. Of course if he wants me to proceed to him immediately that is fine as well. After all I do my best to keep clean for him and my clothes have already been selected so I can heed his call whenever it comes. In any case Momongasama's wishes will always come first" "I understand Albedo. If I waste too much time here I will not have enough to properly serve Momongasama which would be disrespectful. Therefore forgive my abrupt departure but I must take my leave. Floor Guardians I bid you all a good day."
