"If only you had abandoned these villagers on the border you would not be dying here. You probably don't know but your life is far more valuable than even a thousand of these peasants. If you truly love your country you should have abandoned them to die." "You and I... will never see eye to eye... let's go" "What can that body of yours do Cease your pointless struggles and lie down quietly. As a final act of mercy I will kill you without drawing out your suffering." "If you think... I'm helpless... then why don't you come... take my head It should be easy... if I'm like this right" "...Hmph. You're all talk. It looks like you still want to fight. Do you think you can win" Gazef simply stared straight ahead his hands trembling as he gripped his sword. He focused on the enemy in front of him ignoring the angels surrounding him. "...What a pointless effort. Truly you are an idiot. After we kill you we will then massacre the villagers you saved. All you have done is bought them a fearfilled stay of execution." "Kuh. kuh... kuku..." Gazef was smiling brightly. "...What's so funny" "...Hmph you fool. In that village... is a man who is stronger than me. His power is unfathomable but he could take you all out by himself... Trying to kill... the villagers he protects... is impossible for you." "...Someone stronger than the Kingdom's greatest warrior Do you think boasting like that will do you any good You truly are an idiot."
