OVERLORD VOLUME 1 INTERMISSION The pressure that was crushing their heads to the ground suddenly vanished. Even after the departure of the master of their revered creators, nobody raised their heads. After a while, someone sighed in relief. The tense atmosphere was gone now. The first to get up was Albedo. Her white dress was stained where her knee had touched the ground, but she did not mind at all. She flapped her wings to swipe off the dirt on her feathers.

Be. This. Powerful." Thus the Guardians shared their impressions of Momonga. The aura that Momonga emitted was the source of the power that had crushed the Guardians to the ground . [Despair Aura].
