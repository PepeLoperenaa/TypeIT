As Momonga finished, he turned to leave, bringing Albedo with him as he headed to the village. However, after a few steps, a couple of voices called out to him. "Ah... th-thank you for saving us!" "Thank you!" Those words stopped Momonga in his tracks, and when he turned around, he saw the two girls, their eyes brimming with tears as they thanked him. He simply replied: "...Think nothing of it." "And, and this may be thick-skinned of us, but, but you are the only one we can count on. Please! Please save our parents!" "Alright. If they're still alive, I will rescue them." The sisters' eyes went wide as they heard Momonga's words. Their faces reflected the disbelief in their hearts, but soon they came to their senses and lowered their heads in thanks. "Th-thank you! Thank you very much! And, and, may we know..." The girl's voice trailed off, and then she asked in a mumble: "May we know your name...?" Momonga almost responded by reflex, but in the end he did not state his name. The name "Momonga" was that of the guild master of the former Ainz Ooal Gown. Then what should he call himself now? What was the name of the last man who remained in the Great Tomb of Nazarick? -Ah, that's it. "...Remember my name well. I am Ainz Ooal Gown."
