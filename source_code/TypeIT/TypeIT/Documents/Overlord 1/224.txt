His skin was dark and covered in wrinkles. His body was very muscular, and it was obvious that those muscles had been honed through heavy labor. More than half of his hair was white. Though his crudely made cotton shirt was stained by dirt, it did not stink. The tired look on his face made Ainz think he was over 45 years old, but it was hard to tell, because he seemed to have grown older in the past half hour or so. The chief's wife was roughly the same age as her husband. She had been slim and beautiful once, but after long years of working on the farm, that beauty was nowhere to be seen. All that was left were the wrinkles that covered her face. Her shoulder-length black hair was mussed up, and she looked gloomy even under the direct sunlight. "Please, help yourself." The village chief placed a crude-looking cup on the table. Albedo was not here because she was patrolling the village. Ainz raised his hand, refusing the cup of hot, steaming water. He did not feel thirsty, nor could he remove the mask. However, he felt that he should have refused earlier, given that she had gone to so much trouble for him. The trouble in question concerned the boiled water. First, there was the matter of creating sparks with a flint. Then, she had to light wood shavings - or tinder - with those sparks. Then, she had to fan the sparks into flames, and when they were big enough, she had to transfer them to the stove. Then, she had to boil the water, and by the time that was finished, a long time had passed.
