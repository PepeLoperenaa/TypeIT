To date, this body of his had not felt thirst, so it did not bother him. Although he was well aware that the dead would not feel this way, he could not help but think this was all a joke once he realized that he was no longer human. Momonga continued touching himself. He had no skin, muscles, blood vessels, nerves or internal organs. His body was nothing but bones. He vaguely understood it in his heart, but it felt so unreal that he could not help exploring his body with his fingers. His sense of touch seemed duller from when he was a human being, as though there was a thin layer of cloth between his fingers and whatever he was touching. In contrast, his vision, hearing and other senses were sharper than before. One might expect a body composed solely of bones to be easily broken, but each bone felt stronger than steel when he touched them. At the same time, he felt a strange sense of completion and satisfaction, that this was his real body, despite it being completely different from his old one. Perhaps it was because of this feeling that he was not afraid, despite his transfiguration into a set of white bones. "Do you want more?" Momonga raised the Pitcher as he asked the twins, who had finished their water. "Er, thanks! I've drunk enough!" "Is that so? Then, Mare, do you want some more?" "Eep! Er, er, I, I've also had enough. I, I don't feel thirsty any more." Momonga nodded as he took back the glasses, before returning them all into his pocket space. Aura suddenly whispered, "I thought Momonga-sama would be scarier than this."
