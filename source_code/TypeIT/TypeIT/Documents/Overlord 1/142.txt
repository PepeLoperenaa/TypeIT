Besides inflicting a fear effect it could reduce the stats of its victims. Normally it would not have an effect on the level 100 NPCs but on this occasion its effects had been strengthened by the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. "Momongasama must have unleashed the air of authority that represents his right to rule." "Indeed. Before we stated our positions Momongasama did not exert his might. However once we showed ourselves in the role of Floor Guardians he must have revealed a fraction of his awesome power to us." "In. Other. Words. Momongasama. Revealed. His. Face. As. A. Ruler. In. Response. To. Our. Pledges. Of. Loyalty." "That does seem like the case." "He didn't radiate that aura when he was with us. Momongasama was kind and gave us something to drink when we were thirsty." Aura's words caused the other Guardians to emit an air of tension. It was condensed jealousy that was almost visible to the naked eye. The worstoff was Albedo whose clenched fist was trembling and whose nails threatened to rip through the fabric of her glove. Mare's shoulders trembled and then his eyes went wide. "That that must have been the true power of Momongasama the ruler of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. It was amazing" That changed the mood instantly. "Exactly He showed us his ability as an absolute ruler in response to our feelings... as expected of our creator. The zenith of the 41 Supreme Beings and the kind master who remained here with us until the very end." Albedo's words put a blissful look on all the Guardians' faces although the expression on Mare's face was better described as "relaxed".
