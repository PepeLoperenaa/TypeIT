TL Note gachas are slang for gamebased lotteries or lucky draws. Named after gachapons which are coinoperated vending machines which randomly dispense a prize. Because almost all of Ainz Ooal Gown's members were productive members of society most of them were willing to spend money on this hobby and among them Momonga was one of the bigger spenders. He was probably one of the top few on the server. That was how dedicated he was. Adventuring was fun but his greatest joy was found in playing with his friends. To Momonga whose parents had passed away and who had no friends in real life the guild Ainz Ooal Gown was a shining memory of the good times he had had with his friends. And now this guild would disappear. His heart was filled with regret and reluctance. Momonga gripped the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown rightly. He was just an ordinary salaryman and he lacked the financial power or connections to change that fact. He was just another player who could only watch the closing time as it approached. The time on his watch read 2357. The server would shut down at 0000. There little time left. The virtual world would end and he would have to go back to reality the next day. That was only natural. Nobody could live in a virtual world which was why everyone had left one by one. Momonga sighed. He had to wake up at 4 tomorrow. He had to sleep the moment the servers shut down in order not to affect the next day's work. 235935 36 37
