Ainz had a lot of the YGGDRASIL cash items that he had given Gazef. Although he could not replenish his stock of them, giving one away was not a great loss. In addition, Ainz was actually happy to have less of those items. That was because those were consolation prizes from the 500 yen gacha draws, which reminded Ainz of how profligate he had been with his spending and his poor lifestyle then. In addition, while he had spent countless 500 yen coins on finally getting the ultra-rare item that was the top prize, his former comrade Yamaiko had gotten it on the first try. The impact of that incident cast an indelible shadow in Ainz's heart. He had wanted to throw those consolation prizes away, but when he thought of the 500 yen it had cost... he could not bear to wastefully dispose of it. "Well, it doesn't matter who ends up with that item in the end, or if it ends up being used or not. It's no loss to me." "...Would it not have been best to let me take care of things? There was no need to trouble Ainz-sama to personally aid those inferior lifeforms... surrounding them was hardly a difficult task, which is why I submit that Ainzsama did not need to personally take the field." "Is that so..." Without a device to measure power levels, that was all Ainz could say in response. In YGGDRASIL, one could determine the strength of an enemy by the color of their names. Beyond that, one could only rely on information from one's friends and walkthrough sites.
