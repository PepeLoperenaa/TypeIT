observed. Really, if I had known, I would have linked a higher-tier attack spell to it." Those words filled Nigun's eyes with realization. The Slaine Theocracy must have been spying on him. "A widened [Explosion] might not be enough to teach them how to behave... oh well, things being as they are, playtime is over." A wave of cold ran through Nigun as he picked up the hidden meaning in those words. He, who had always been the oppressor, was now going to become one of the oppressed. He was filled with an incomparable fear. The fear that he, who had taken countless lives in the past, was now going to have his own life taken. His subordinates saw his terrified expression and it frightened them as well. He was on the verge of tears. He wanted to kneel down and loudly beg for his life, but Ainz did not look like a compassionate man. Thus, Nigun fought back the urge to weep, trying his best to look for a way to survive. But no matter how he thought, he could not think of any way to get help from the outside. Therefore, his only hope was to throw himself on the mercy of Ainz Ooal Gown. "Wait, wait a bit! Ainz Ooal Gown-dono, no, -sama! Please wait, we, no, I wish to make a deal with you! I guarantee you will not be disappointed! As long as you spare me, I will give you any amount of money you want!"
