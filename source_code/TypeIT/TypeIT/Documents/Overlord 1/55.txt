"Damn you" Blood streamed from a small cut on her father's face. He must have gotten hurt while bullrushing the knight. Enri's father was rolling around as he grappled with the knight on the ground. The knight grabbed the hand of Enri's father which was holding a knife while he in turn kept the knight from drawing his shortsword. The sight of blood on the body of one of her family members made Enri's mind go white. She wavered over whether to help her father or run away. "Enri Nemu" Her mother's shouts helped Enri regain herself and as she looked at her mother she saw the older woman shaking her head with a heartbreaking expression on her face. Enri grabbed her little sister's hand and ran after her mother with big strides. Guilt and hesitation clawed at her heart but in the end she knew they had to flee into the Great Forest of Tob. The neighing of horses angry shouts the clash of steel and the stench of burning flesh. All these assaulted Enri's ears and nose from the direction of the village. Where had it come from Enri ran with all her might as she tried to make sense of matters. When fleeing to an open space she had to make her body as small as possible or hide in the corners of houses. The violent beating of her heart chipped away at the fear that threatened to freeze her body solid. In addition the small hand she held in hers spurred her on. Her sister. Her mother who was running ahead of her suddenly froze and immediately doubled back her hands frantically gesturing at them to run somewhere else.
