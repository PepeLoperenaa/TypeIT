This was not unique to Momonga most players who valued power would spend that money too. One of the nine rings Momonga wore had an emblem on it which resembled the symbol embroidered onto the large red banner behind the throne. That ring was called the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown. Every member of Ainz Ooal Gown possessed the magic ring that Momonga wore on his right ring finger. Although he could use the power of ten rings at once with the aid of cash items when he applied the cash item he had to decide which ring he wanted to assign to which finger and that decision was irrevocable. Even so Momonga had removed the ring on his left ring finger and sent it to the Treasury. The reason why Momonga had assigned that somewhat weaker ring to that finger was because it would be very useful under certain circumstances but he rarely wore it because it had a constant effect. The power of the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown was unlimited teleportation between named rooms of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick and it would even allow one to teleport into the Tomb from the outside. Since Nazarick was warded to block teleportation into or within itself except for a few specific areas this ring was very handy. The only places where this ring could not teleport its wearer was to the Throne Room and the various guild members' personal rooms. This ring was also required to enter the Treasury which was why he could not do without it. Momonga sighed deeply. After this he would be using the ring's power. He was not sure if the ring could still do everything he expected of it but he had no choice except to test it out. As he unleashed the ring's power  the world before him instantly turned black.
