Apart from the large central mausoleum there were four smaller mausoleums in the north south east and west each defended by statues of armored warriors each six meters tall. The central mausoleum was the gateway to the Great Tomb of Nazarick and it was from this place that Momonga had emerged into the outside world. Momonga stood at the top of the stairs and quietly surveyed the landscape before him. The Great Tomb of Nazarick had originally been located in the icy world of Helheim which was perpetually shrouded in darkness. The atmosphere was grim and dark and the sky was constantly overcast. Yet what he saw now was vastly different from that. He was looking at a beautiful night sky. Momonga looked to the heavens and he could not help but sigh. He shook his head as though unable to believe his eyes. "Amazing... to think they could include such detail in a virtual world... the air here is so fresh that it must never have been polluted. People born in this world wouldn't need artificial lungs to breathe..." He had never seen such a clear night sky in his life. Momonga wanted to cast a spell but he was hampered by his armor. There was a certain mage class that allowed for the casting of spells in armor but Momonga did not have that class. As a result his full plate armor kept him from using magic. Even armor created by magic would not allow its wearer to cast spells while wearing it. Currently there were only five spells he could use in his armored state but sadly the flight magic Momonga wanted to use was not part of them. Momonga reached his hand into his pocket dimension and withdrew an item. It was a necklace with a pendant shaped like a bird's wing. He put on the necklace and focused on it. The power buried within the necklace took effect.
