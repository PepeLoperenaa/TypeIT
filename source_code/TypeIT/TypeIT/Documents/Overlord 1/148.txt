"Well I'll teach you about that when the time comes. But if you decide to try some breeding experiments on your own Momongasama might scold you. After all the operations of Nazarick are perfectly balanced." "That that's true. I've heard that all the underlings were created after careful calculation by one of the Supreme Beings... If we carelessly increase our numbers we'll be scolded. I I don't want to be scolded by Momongasama..." "Of course I don't want to be rebuked by the Supreme Beings either... if only I could set up a farm outside Nazarick..." As Demiurge thought of this he decided to mention the one thing nobody had teased him about "Ah yes Mare why are you dressed as a girl" Mare grabbed at his miniskirt to hide his legs after Demiurge asked his question. "This was Bukubukuchagamasama's decision. She said this was called a 'trap' so it should have nothing to do with my gender." "Oh so this was Bukubukuchagamasama's decision. Well then those clothes should be fine on you... although should all boys dress in that way" "I I don't know about that." The 41 Supreme Beings were no longer around but even so the mention of their names still compelled obedience. Or rather in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick Mare was dressed as he should be and nobody apart from another Supreme Being could change his wardrobe. "...I wonder if I should talk to Momongasama about this. Perhaps all boys should be dressed like that. I say... Cocytus it's time to wake up." After hearing his colleague's words Cocytus shook his head several times a deeply satisfied smile on his face.
