There was no way for anyone to detect the mirror's surveillance apart from anti-divination spells. Frothy blood leaked from the villager's mouth as he tried to open his mouth. His eyes were unfocused, and Momonga could not tell where he was looking. Even so, with what may have been his dying breaths, he gasped his last words: -Please save my daughter- "What do you intend to do?" Sebas seemed to have been waiting for this moment to speak. There could only be one answer. Momonga replied coldly: "Nothing. There is no reason, value or benefit in rescuing them." "-Understood." Momonga nonchalantly looked at Sebas - at the phantom image of his past guildmate. "This... Touch Me-san..." Just then, Momonga remembered something. -Saving someone in trouble is common sense. When Momonga had just started out in YGGDRASIL, hunting down characters of heteromorphic races was a common practice, and Momonga, who had chosen such a race, had been PKed countless times. Just when he was about to leave YGGDRASIL, those words, spoken by that man, had saved him. If not for those words, Momonga would not be here. Momonga sighed softly, and then he smiled. Now that he had recalled that memory, he had no choice but to go save them.
