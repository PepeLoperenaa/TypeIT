Each of the 41 guild members had designed their own NPCs so he could not understand why anyone would want to treat the NPCs they had designed themselves in this manner. Perhaps he would understand why after reading that long essay of flavor text. However there were guild members who would come up with these unconventional designs. Albedo's designer Tabula Smaragdina was one of those people. "Ah is this what they call gap moe Tabulasan... even so..." Isn't a backstory like this far too much Momonga could not help but think that. All the NPCs made by everyone were an inheritance of the guild. Designing the highestranked NPC Albedo in this manner made him think that Tabula Smaragdina was beyond saving. "Umu." Would it be fine to change an NPC's backstory based on a personal decision After thinking about it for some time Momonga came to a conclusion. "Should I change it" Currently with the guild weapon in his possession Momonga could be said to be the master of the guild. It should be all right to exercise the guildmaster's authority he had never used before. Momonga's doubts vanished like mist as he steeled himself to right the wrongs of his guildmate. He extended the staff of Ainz Ooal Gown that he was holding. Normally one would need developer tools to change a character's backstory but by through his power as guildmaster he could directly access her settings and edit them. After some action on his console the "slut" line vanished. "Well it should be like that."
