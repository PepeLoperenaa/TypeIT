In contrast the Death Knight did not use its sword but sent Londes flying with a shield bash and it did so without using enough force to kill. It was clearly toying with them from the way it did not use its full strength. It was plain to see that the Death Knight wanted to enjoy the dying struggles of these humans. The Death Knight only dealt fatal blows in earnest when the knights tried to escape. The first knight to run was Ririk. He was a nice guy but a bad drunk. His limbs were chopped off followed by his head. After seeing the two deaths the other knights knew the score so they did not dare to flee. Their attacks were ineffective and they would be killed if they tried to run. The only thing they could do was wait their turn to be tortured to death. Although there was no way to see their faces below the full helms they wore everyone present was keenly aware of their fate. The wails of grown men reduced to children echoed throughout the village. These men who had always oppressed the weak had not thought that one day they would be on the receiving end of that treatment. "Oh god please save me..." "Oh god..." After hearing these cries for salvation the strength left Londes' legs and he almost fell to his knees. He loudly cursed the gods  or was it a prayer to them "You you lot go hold that monster back" a desperate knight shouted. He knew that his fate was sealed. His words sounded like an offkey psalm.
