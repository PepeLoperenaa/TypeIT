"It's fine Albedo. Until my former comrades arrive that is my name. I permit you to shorten it." "I understand... no but please let me address you with the appropriate respect. Then then... my master AiAinzsama... kukuku... yes that's right..." Albedo twisted her body shyly. However since she was in full body armor Ainz could not see her beautiful face. To him she was just acting strangely. "Could could it be... kukuku... could it be that I'm the only one who's allowed to address you in such a way" "No. Having someone address me by such a long name all the time would be annoying so I would like to have everyone do the same thing." "...Is that so... ah that's right. Yes that's what I thought" Albedo's mood turned gloomy all of a sudden. In an uneasy voice Ainz asked "...Albedo what do you think of the name I chose" "I think that name suits you very well. It fits my beloved  cough cough  it fits you in your capacity as the one who united the Supreme Beings." "...This name was intended to represent the 41 of us and this includes your maker Tabula Smaragdinasan. However I ignored the feelings of your master and the others and took that name for myself on a whim. How do you think they would feel about that" "...Although I fear to anger you... I pray you will allow me to speak. If my words displease you then I will gladly take my own life if you command it. I feel that some of the Supreme Beings who abandoned us might object to that name being used by the one who stayed with us until now Momongasama. However they are not here so if you wish to use that name all I feel is happiness Momongasama ." Albedo lowered her head after she finished speaking and Ainz remained silent.
