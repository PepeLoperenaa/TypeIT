Momonga's heart ached briefly as the maid ate it up hook line and sinker but he brushed it aside. There should not be anything wrong with taking a short break and going outside to check out the surrounding scenery. Indeed it was very important that he saw for himself whether they had indeed been transported to another world. The excuses were welling up because Momonga was starting to feel that he had been too selfish. Momonga waved away the guilt in his heart and activated the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown.    His destination was a large hall. There were rows of narrow mortuary slabs on both sides of him but there were no corpses on them now. The floor was polished limestone. Behind Momonga was a flight of stairs leading down and at their end was a set of double doors through which one could access the 1st Floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. The sconces in the walls had no torches the only light came from the bluishwhite moonlight streaming in from the outside. This was the closest location to the surface that the RIng of Ainz Ooal Gown could take him the central mausoleum on the surface of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. All he needed to do was take a few steps to reach the outside world. But despite the vast space before him Momonga could not take those steps. That was because of the thoroughly unexpected encounter before him. The silhouettes of heteromorphic beings loomed before him. There were three monsters in total. One of them looked like a fearsome demon. Fangs protruded from its mouth and its body was covered in scales. It had stout arms and sharp claws as well as flaming wings and a snakelike tail.
