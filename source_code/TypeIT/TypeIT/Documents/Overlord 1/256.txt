"...Humanity is weak and it uses any and all means to defend itself. Anyone who doesn't know that is an utter and complete fool." One of the subordinates seemed to have sensed the anger smoldering in Nigun's glassy black eyes and interjected "But but the Kingdom is foolish too." Nigun did not answer although he agreed with those words. Gazef was very strong so in order to weaken him they had to deprive him of his panoply.    The Kingdom was divided into the Noble and the Royal factions. Since they were opposed to Gazef a prominent figure in the Royal faction the Noble faction was easily led to take political action to eliminate him. They did not even pause to consider that the impetus for their deeds came from a foreign power. Gazef was a commoner who had risen to his current station by dint of his swordplay and so the nobles despised him. And that had led to this conclusion. The Kingdom's trump card would soon be lost by their own hands. That was a supremely foolish move to Nigun. They  the Slaine Theocracy  might be divided into six sects but whenever they needed to act they did so as one. One reason for that was because everyone respected each other's gods. The other was because everyone knew that there were many inhuman tribes and monsters in this world and that they would be in danger if they did not work together.
