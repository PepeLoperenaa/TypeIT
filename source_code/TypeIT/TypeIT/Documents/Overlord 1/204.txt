Part 4 "OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH" The mighty roar shattered the air. It was the signal for a slaughter to become a massacre of a different sort. In the blink of an eye the hunters had become the hunted. Londes Di Gelanpo had probably cursed his gods more times in the past ten seconds than he had in the rest of his life. If the gods really did exist then they should defeat that evil being right now. Londes was a faithful man  why had the gods abandoned him The gods did not exist. In the past he had looked down on those people who did not believe in the gods as fools. After all if the gods did not exist how could the priests work their magic And now he realised that he was the foolish one. The monster before him  a Death Knight for want of a better word  drew closer. He took two steps back in response trying to get away from it. A shrill creaking noise came from his armor and the sword he clutched in both hands was trembling uncontrollably. He was not the only one the other 18 knights surrounding the Death Knight were all acting the same way. Although they were filled with fear none of them ran. This was not courage  the grinding of their teeth could attest to that. If they could they would run as fast and as far as they could. It was because they knew there was no escape. Londes' eyes shifted pleading for help.
