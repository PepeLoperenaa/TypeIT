Ainz Ooal Gown was a guild that had always roleplayed as villains through PKing and thus they were a muchhated guild. He could not be sure that he had shed that negative image. For all he knew the other players might want to take revenge on him out of a sense of justice and righteous anger. In order to avoid others declaring a vendetta on him he had to refrain from doing anything that antagonized the surrounding people. For instance massacring the local populace  especially innocent civilians  might enrage those players who had not yet lost their humanity. Of course it would be a different matter if there was a reason which would satisfy them such as killing the knights who were trying to sack this village. In any event it would be better if future actions were taken for a highsounding reason. That also meant he might have to do things he did not like but that could not be helped. If the people he met bore hatred toward Ainz Ooal Gown then combat would be unavoidable. To that end he had to draw up a plan and countermeasures if that situation took place. Given the current strength of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick's defenses they could easily overwhelm about 30 level 100 players. In addition they could use WorldClass Items in their defense so it was a nighimpregnable fortress. They would probably be able to repel invaders like they had in the past. However it was easy to see how dire the situation could be without reinforcements. In addition the trump card of Ainz Ooal Gown  their WorldClass Items  would drain Ainz's levels every time he unleashed their full power. If they were attacked in succession the time might come when the WorldClass Items would become unusable. Ainz was very clear that wargaming a scenario like this in his head was prone to bias and tunnel vision. However Ainz was no longer a child and he always considered the worstcase scenario before taking any action. This was simply thinking of how to take care of a problem before it happened.
