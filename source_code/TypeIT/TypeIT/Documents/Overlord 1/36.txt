Momonga felt that way as he looked around the large hall. "...Will these two statues attack?" He was right to feel so uneasy. Even Momonga did not fully grasp the secrets of all the mechanisms in this dungeon. It would not be strange if one of the retired guild members had left a strange sort of present for him. And the one who had designed this set of doors was just such a person. In the past, he had designed a very powerful golem, but shortly after activation, a flaw in the combat AI made itself known and it had attacked everyone around it. To this day, Momonga still had his doubts about whether that "mistake" had been on purpose. "Hey, LuciFer-san, if they really attack me, I'll be mad, you know." However, Momonga's caution in reaching for the doors was unfounded. As he touched them, they opened by themselves - although, they did so slowly, in deference to their massive weight. The air changed. Although the atmosphere from earlier was filled with quiet solemnity, the scene before his eyes now exceeded that by far. The air became a pressure that weighed heavily on the entire body. It was an exquisite piece of work. And in this wide, high room - Even packing several hundred people inside would not make the room feel crowded. The high ceiling and the surrounding walls were a predominantly white color, with golden decorations as highlights.
