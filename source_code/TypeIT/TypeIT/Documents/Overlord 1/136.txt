"Each Floor is administered by its respective Floor Guardian but Demiurge is the overall defense commander and everyone can share information with him." Momonga was a bit surprised but then he nodded in satisfaction. "Excellent. Nazarick's defense commander Demiurge. Guardian Overseer Albedo. The two of you will be in charge of drawing up a more comprehensive administrative system for Nazarick." "Understood. Will the plans for the management system include the 8th 9th and 10th floors" "The 8th Floor is managed by Victim so it'll be fine. No entry to the 8th Floor is forbidden. I rescind the order I just gave to Albedo as well. In short entry to the 8th Floor will only be effected with my permission. I will undo the seal and permit direct access from the 7th Floor to the 9th Floor. After that plan for the 9th and 10th Floor as one whole." "Is is that your will" Albedo seemed quite surprised. Behind her Demiurge's eyes went wide revealing his thoughts on the matter. "Will the underlings be allowed to tramp through the domain of the Supreme Beings Must they be given that much freedom" The underlings in question were not the NPCs and monsters designed by the members of Ainz Ooal Gown but the automatically spawned pop monsters from the dungeon. The fact was that the 9th and 10th Floor lacked such monsters barring very rare exceptions. Momonga muttered to himself. Albedo seemed to regard that place as a holy sanctuary but that was not the case.
