Nigun had never seen anyone defeat it with just one spell. Even the Black Scripture whose members' power pressed against the limits of humanity could not do it. In other words Ainz Ooal Gown's power exceeded that of mankind. "It's can't be It's impossible Nobody can defeat a hightier angel with just one spell What kind of man are you Ainz Ooal Gown It's impossible that nobody's heard of you before What is your real name" There was no trace of calm left in Nigun just his wild screaming in the hope of denying reality. Ainz spread his hands once more. Under the light of the setting sun the looked like they were drenched in blood. "...Why do you think it is impossible Is that not just the result of your ignorance Or do you mean to say that this is all you know of the world There is only one thing I can do to answer your question." Silenced reigned in the air as they awaited the answer. Ainz's voice was as clear as a bell "My name is Ainz Ooal Gown. That is definitely not an alias." In the face of Ainz's arrogance Nigun was unable to rebutt what he was hearing. It was something he did not understand from a man he did not know. That was the situation he was in. Nigun was starting to get annoyed by his rapid breathing.
