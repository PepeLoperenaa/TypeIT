As Momonga silently applauded the wonders of magic he peeked at himself in the mirror from between the gaps of his closed helm. A dashing warrior looked back at him nothing at all like a magician. Momonga nodded in satisfaction and gulped in his nonexistent throat. Right now he understood how a child felt when he angered his parents. "I will be stepping out for a while." "The guards are ready for you" the maid reflexively replied. However The truth was he disliked them. On the first day when the guards followed him around he felt pressurized on the second he was used to it and then he felt like showing them off. And on the third day Momonga suppressed the urge to sigh. It was all too stiff and formal for him. The guards followed him everywhere he went and whenever he met someone they bowed to him. Maybe if he could have walked around nonchalantly with his guards in tow it would have been tolerable. But he could not do that because he had to maintain the gravitas of the ruler of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick at all times. He could not allow a moment of laxity to ruin his image so his nerves were constantly on edge. This caused a lot of stress to the formerlyhuman Momonga. Even though strong emotions were promptly suppressed his mind felt like it was being boiled by a low flame all the time. And then there were the unbelievably beautiful women who plastered themselves to his side at all times taking care of him in all ways. As a man he was delighted by the attention but the invasion of his personal space and his life was wearing him out as well. That stress was another relic of his humanity.
