The magic sealed within the crystal could summon the most powerful angel known to man. It was an angel that had singlehandedly destroyed a Demon God that rampaged throughout the land 200 years ago. It was an angel of the highest order that could easily destroy a city. Casting the spell to summon that angel again required an incalculable amount of money and manpower but Ainz Ooal Gown this mysterious being was worthy of being eliminated by its power. More importantly it would be worse if the crystal was taken without the spell being cast. This was what Nigun told himself. He concealed his fear that he would become a lump of meat like his deceased underling. "I am going to summon an angel of the highest order hurry up and buy me some time" Once they realized the truth his subordinates moved swiftly. Ainz who was facing them should have noticed the flames of hope blazing up. However he made no move instead babbling about some nonsense to himself. "...Could that be a spellsealing crystal... and from its brilliance it should be something that can seal anything except a supertier spell. So they have a YGGDRASIL item like that as well... that being the case what kind of angel can they summon... Seraphclass Albedo protect me with your skill. While I don't think they can bring out a Seraph Aesphere if they manage to summon a Seraph Empyrean we will have to fight them seriously. Or rather... could it be a monster unique to this world"
