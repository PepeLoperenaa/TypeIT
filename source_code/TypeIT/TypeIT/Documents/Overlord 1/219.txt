If there were no villagers around, he might even have stretched his shoulders. Although he was doing the same thing in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, playing the role of a dignified person was very tiring for an average salaryman like Ainz. Yet, until the curtains closed on this act of his, he had to wear yet another mask. Ainz resisted the urge to sigh and walked toward the villagers. Albedo followed behind him, her every step accompanied by the clanking of metal. "-Clear up your zombie slaves," Ainz ordered the Death Knight. As Ainz drew closer to them, he could more clearly see the confusion and unease on the villagers' faces. It was not that they were not happy at being rescued from the knights, but frightened by the person before them. Ainz finally realised this. He was powerful, much more so than those knights, so he did not consider this situation from a weak person's point of view. He decided to reflect on this, and pondered it quietly. If he went too close to them, the outcome would be the opposite of what he was hoping for. Therefore, Ainz decided to stop at a distance from them, and spoke in a kindly tone. "You have been saved. Be at ease." "You, you are..." One of the villagers was saying that, but even in the middle of speaking to Ainz, his eyes never left the Death Knight. "I saw someone attacking this village, so I came here to help." "Ohh..." As the noises spilled out, looks of relief dawned on the faces of the villagers. Even so, they could not be completely at ease.
