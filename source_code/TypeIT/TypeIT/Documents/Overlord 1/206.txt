"Aiiiiieee!" Their panicked squeals echoed through the air. One of the men huddled together with his comrades could not bear the oppressive terror and fled with a scream. Under these extreme circumstances, it was only natural that - when stretched to the breaking point - people would snap. However, among all of the fleeing man's comrades, not one of them joined him. The reason was that would soon be evident. A black gale whirled past the field of Londes' vision. The Death Knight's body was larger than a normal human's, but its nimble grace was far beyond anyone's expectations. The fleeing man only managed to take three steps. Just as he was about to take his fourth step, an arc of silver brilliance cleaved his body in two. The bisected left and right halves of his body collapsed in opposite directions. A sour stench filled the air as his pink internal organs spilled out. "GUWOOOOOOOOOOHHH!" the blood-covered Death Knight roared as it swung its sword. It was a roar of joy. Its look of delight was unmistakeable, even on its rotted face. As an overwhelmingly superior slaughterer, it savored the despair and terror of the pitiful humans who could not even survive a single one of its blows. Nobody dared attack, though they had swords in hand. At first, they had tried an attack, though they were afraid. But even those blades which had made it past their foe's defense could not strike a telling blow through the Death Knight's armor.
