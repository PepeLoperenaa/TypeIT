"Ignorance is truly deplorable. You will pay the price for your foolishness." "...Really now. Do you really think that will happen I observed your battle earlier so my presence here would indicate that I am confident of victory. After all if I was not sure that I could beat you would it not be wiser for me to leave that man to die" He was right. An arcane magic caster would be better suited to different kinds of confrontations. Arcaners sorcerers and wizards could only use light armor so they would want to avoid melee combat using Fly to repeatedly launch Fireballs and other such spells from afar. Yet Ainz had chosen to face them headon. He must have a trick up his sleeve. After a period of silence Ainz spoke again "I have a question for you if you can understand it. The angels you have brought with you should have been summoned by 3rdtier magic. Am I correct" He was stating the obvious. Ainz went on ignoring Nigun's puzzled expression "The monsters you summoned are similar to those in YGGDRASIL so I was curious as to whether the names were the same. Many of YGGDRASIL's monsters were derived from mythology... monsters like angels or demons should be no exception. Said angels and demons are most commonly associated with Christianity but it seems quite unnatural that something called an archangel exists in a world without Christianity. That would mean someone like myself must exist in this world."
