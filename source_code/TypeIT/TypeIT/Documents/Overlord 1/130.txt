Shalltear who stood on one end of the line stepped forward "Shalltear Bloodfallen Guardian of the 1st 2nd and 3rd Floors presents herself to the Master." She went to one knee one hand pressed against her chest and bowed deeply. After that Cocytus stepped forward and said "Cocytus. Guardian. Of. The. 5th. Floor. Presents. Himself. To. The. Master." Much like Shalltear had he knelt before Momonga like a vassal before a lord. Then it was the twin dark elves' turn "The Guardian of the 6th Floor Aura Bella Fiora presents herself to the Master." "Alalso a Guardian of the 6th Floor Mare Bello Fiore presents himself to the Master." They knelt respectfully and lowered their heads to Momonga. Shalltear Cocytus Aura and Mare all had different bodies and thus they should have each taken their steps forward differently. Yet the way with which they knelt was identical and they lined up neatly. After that Demiurge advanced in a dignified manner. "The Guardian of the 7th Floor Demiurge presents himself to the Master." Following his crisp words Demiurge went to one knee in a graceful descent as though expressing his heart through his actions. Finally Albedo stepped forward as well. "The Guardian Overseer Albedo presents herself to the Master." She smiled to Momonga and knelt like the other Guardians. However Albedo continued speaking in a high and clear voice as she delivered her report to Momonga.
