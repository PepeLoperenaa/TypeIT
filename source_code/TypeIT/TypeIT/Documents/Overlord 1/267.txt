magic. For all he knew, both Gazef and the houses might go up in smoke together. Therefore, the last tactic he could use was a thoroughly unethical one. That was to say, he would have to shift the theater of battle into the village and draw Ainz Ooal Gown into the fight, thus forcing his involvement. But if he did that, it would completely defeat the purpose of coming here in the first place. Therefore, Gazef had to put himself into danger. "Hit the enemy hard and draw in the sentries from around the village. After that, fall back immediately. Do not hesitate and miss your chance to flee." After hearing the energetic replies from behind him, Gazef frowned. How many of the men here would be able to go back alive? They were not any more talented than ordinary people. Nor were they born with superpowers or special talents. They were just a group of men who had trained hard under Gazef. Losing the fruits of his labor here would be a terrible waste. Gazef was going to make a stupid, senseless sacrifice, and his men were going to follow him into it. He wanted to apologize to these men, that he had drawn in with him, but once he turned around and saw them, those words died in his mouth. What he saw were the faces of true warriors, fearless men who knew where they were headed and who had swallowed any complaints about the matter.. There was no need to apologize for the looks on his men's faces, that look which said that they knew they were riding into danger, but they would go into it regardless. One by one, the men shouted to the embarrassed Gazef: "Don't worry, Warrior-Captain!" "Yeah, we all came here of our own free will, to fight and die by your side, Warrior-Captain!"
