"But but we've already given the order." His subordinates' confused voices startled Nigun and he looked at Ainz again. The angels were desperately flapping their wings like butterflies caught in a spider's web. The two angels slowly moved to the side. However their movements were very strange. It looked as though someone was pushing them aside. Following that the body of Ainz  which had been blocked by the angels  appeared once more from the gap between them. "...I told you didn't I There is no way you gentlemen can defeat me. Shouldn't you heed the warnings of others" The calm voice filtered into Nigun's ears. He could not comprehend the sight before him. He was stabbed through his chest and abdomen but Ainz was still standing as though nothing were wrong. "Impossible..." one of Nigun's subordinates moaned giving voice to the words in Nigun's heart. Judging from the angle of the angels' swords they had to be fatal wounds. Even so Ainz did not seem to be in any pain. That was not the only shocking thing. Ainz was gripping each of the angels by the throat. The angels struggled against him but Ainz did not let them go.
