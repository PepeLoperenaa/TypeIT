The two of them spoke with the voices of grown men but compared to the voice of the former the latter's words lacked force or perhaps it could be said that they lacked energy. "You stopped coming online after you changed your job IRL so how long has it been... about 2 years" "Ah  seems about right  wah it's been so long... This is bad. I've been doing so much overtime recently that my sense of time is starting to go weird." "That's really bad right Are you okay" "My body Well it's a mess. I haven't had to see a doctor yet but I'm almost there it's really bad. A lot of times I feel like I want to run away from it all but then I think about how I need money to live and then I go back to work like a whipped slave." "Uwah" The Overlord  Momonga  lowered his head in an "I can't take it" gesture. "That's terrible." As though following up on Momonga's comment Herohero delivered a grim monologue his words laced with an unimaginable reality. The two of them griped loudly about the foolishness they encountered in their working lives. Subordinates who did not know how to report communicate and discuss things spreadsheets that changed by the day scoldings by their superiors for not meeting various KPIs working late every day until they could not go home gaining weight because of their irregular lifestyles and the increasing amounts of medicine they had to take every day. Herohero's grievances burst forth like a broken dam and Momonga lent his ear to him.
