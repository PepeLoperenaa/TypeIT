In other words, this maid was the personification of his past friends' hard work. He could not simply ignore her without feeling bad about it. After all, this maid was also a part of the glorious history of Ainz Ooal Gown. Just as Momonga was contemplating these matters, the maid raised her head, as though she had spotted something, and tilted her head in surprise. The maids would do this if anyone lingered around them for longer than a certain period of time. As Momonga searched through his memories, he could not help but be impressed by Herohero's elaborate programming. There should have been other hidden poses programmed into them as well. Momonga wanted to see them all, but time was very tight. Momonga glanced at the translucent watch on his left wrist and checked the time. As he thought, there was no time for him to spend waffling around. "Thank you for your hard work." Momonga walked past the maid after that painful farewell. As he passed the maid, there was no response, but that was only to be expected. Still, even if she did not reply to him, Momonga still felt that it had to be said, because it was the last day of YGGDRASIL. Momonga continued forward, leaving the maid behind. After a while, a gigantic staircase appeared before Momonga's eyes. It was wide enough that over 10 people could walk down it side by side, arms outstretched, with no problems. A luxurious red carpet lay on the steps. Momonga slowly descended the stairs, until he reached the lowest floor - the 10th floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. The place where he had arrived was a large receiving room, with several figures within.
