If the spell had been resisted his plan was to take the two girls and jump back into the still open Gate. He had already planned his route of retreat since he was not sure what his opponents could do. However it would seem those preparations would not be necessary. A feeling of something soft crushing beneath Momonga's fingers travelled up his arm and the knight collapsed silently to the ground Momonga looked down upon the fallen knight. It would seem that even killing someone did not stir any emotions within him. There was no guilt fear or confusion in his heart which was like the surface of a calm lake. Why was it like this "I see... so it's not just my body but my mind that's no longer human." Momonga took a step forward. The elder sister squeaked in confusion as Momonga walked past her probably in fear at the knight's demise. Momonga had clearly come to rescue her. However the girl was seemingly confused by Momonga's sudden appearance and actions. What was she thinking Although he had his doubts Momonga did not have time to worry about them. After verifying the wounds on the elder sister's back through her tatty old clothes Momonga put the girls behind him and glared at a knight who had just emerged from a nearby house. The knight saw Momonga as well and took a step back in fear. "...So you dare to chase girls but not someone who can fight back" As Momonga stared down the quivering knight he considered what spell to use next.
