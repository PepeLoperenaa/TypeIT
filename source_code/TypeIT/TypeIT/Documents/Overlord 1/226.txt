Ainz was quite surprised to receive such unreserved gratitude. When he looked back on his past life, he had never been thanked like this before. No, the sisters he rescued earlier had acted that way too. Well, had never rescued someone before, so he thought that their reaction was only natural. That was a relic from his time as a human being - as Suzuki Satoru. Although he was somewhat embarrassed by this earnest appreciation, he certainly did not dislike it. "Please, raise your heads. Like I said earlier, I did not help you for free." "We know that, but still, we wish to thank you for rescuing us and many of the other villagers." "...Then, paying me more will be good enough. Come, let us discuss it. You must have many things to do, village chief-dono." "Nothing could be more important than spending time with our savior, but I understand." The chief slowly raised his head, and Ainz racked his nonexistent brains. His goal here was to obtain information through conversation, rather than through magic. -What a pain. He still remembered the tricks he had used as an office worker. How effective would they be here? Hopefully, at least half of them would be useful. After steeling himself against the possibility of failure, Ainz asked: "...Let us get to the point. How much can you pay me?" "We would not dare deceive our savior. I do not know how many silver and copper pieces we can gather if we do not collect them from everyone, but I believe we can muster up at least 3000 copper pieces."
