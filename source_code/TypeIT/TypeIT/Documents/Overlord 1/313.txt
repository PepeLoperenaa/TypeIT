He could see his shocked subordinates out of the corner of his eye, but they were no longer relevant to him. The thing that mattered now was his own life. Everything else was of secondary importance. Besides, he could find more subordinates, but his own self was irreplaceable. Ignoring the countless angry voices of his men, Nigun continued: "It must be difficult to satisfy the tastes of such a great magic caster as yourself, but I will definitely prepare enough money to please you! I have a position of some power in my country, so they will definitely pay any price to ransom me! Of course, if you desire anything else, I will do my best to meet your wishes! So I beg you! Please spare my life!" Nigun panted as he finished his monologue. "What, what about it? Ainz Ooal Gown-sama!" A delicate, gentle woman's voice responded to Nigun's desperate plea: "Did you not reject the compassionate offer of the Supreme One, Ainz-sama?" "That is!" "...I know what you want to say. You wanted to beg for your life because accepting his proposition would also mean your death. Am I correct?" The black-helmeted head shook, as though it were tired of talking. "You seem to have gotten the wrong idea. Since Ainz-sama, who holds the power of life and death in Nazarick, has already stated his will, inferior lifeforms like you humans should lower your heads and gratefully await the taking of your lives."
