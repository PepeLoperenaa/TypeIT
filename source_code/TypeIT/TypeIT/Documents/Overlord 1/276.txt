They were simply too far apart. "The beast is about to make a break for it. Show him the meaning of the word 'impossible'." The man's calm voice only served to aggravate Gazef further. Even if he stepped into the realm of heroes Gazef could not win with his refined melee techniques alone. Still  so what If that was the only road available to him then he would have to charge down it with all his strength. As the strength returned to his eyes Gazef began his charge. However the road ahead was hard like he had expected. The angels loomed before him one after the after swinging their swords of scorching red flame. As he evaded and counterattacked and destroyed the angels one after the other Gazef suddenly felt an intense pain. It felt like he had been struck hard in the belly. As he looked in the direction of the pain he saw a group of magic casters casting a spell of some sort. "Well if you're priests you should act like it. How about a little healing over here" As though to answer Gazef's jibe an invisible force smashed into Gazef's body. Even if the enemy used invisible attacks Gazef was confident that he could avoid them by reading traces in the air and the looks on his opponent's faces. That might even have worked if there were only a few of them. However against 30 of those attacks there was nothing he could do. Just keeping his sword in his hands was taking all his strength. The pain filled his whole body. He had no idea where it was coming from only that it was so great it almost made him collapse.
