And so  the girl gazed upon despair. What she saw was darkness. It was an infinitesimally thin yet unfathomably deep blackness. It was a halfoval of obsidian that seemed to protrude from the earth. It was a mysterious sight that filled the ones watching it with a powerful sense of unease. Was it a door The girl could not help but think so after she saw what lay before her. As her heart lurched the girl's conjecture was confirmed. Something seemed to be coming out of that shadowy passage. And in the moment that it resolved itself in her eyes "Hiiiiiiii" A deafening shriek came from the girl. It was an opponent humanity could not overcome. Twin points of crimson light burned brightly within the empty orbits of a bleached skull. Those two points of light coldly scanned the girl and the others present like a predator sizing up its prey. Within its fleshless hands it grasped a magic staff that seemed divine in nature yet inspired dread in equal measure. It was like a crystallization of all the beauty in the world. It wore an intricately detailed black robe and it resembled nothing so much as an incarnation of death born from the darkness of another world. In an instant the air seemed to freeze. It was as though time itself had stood still in the wake of a Supreme Being's advent.
