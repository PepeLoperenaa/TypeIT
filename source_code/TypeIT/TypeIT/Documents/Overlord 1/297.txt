"...Huh?" Nobody knew what had happened. They were the ones who had launched the attack, yet the result was completely opposite - one of them had fallen instead. One of the men went over to inspect his dead comrade, and he shouted: "His, his head's been smashed in!" "...What? Smashed... don't tell me it's the sling bullet he threw!" Why had he been killed by his own projectile? Just then, the wind carried a voice into the puzzled Nigun's ears. "My apologies, it would seem my subordinate used a combination of the Missile Parry and Counter Arrow skills to return your projectile to your man. I believe you have some sort of magic which defends against ranged attacks on your persons. That would mean an attack that is stronger than the defense will break through it, no? It's hardly worth panicking about." After his explanation, Ainz paid no attention to Nigun, and turned to Albedo: "Although, Albedo, you should know that ranged weapons like that will not be able to harm me. There was no need to-" "-Please wait, Ainz-sama. Anyone who wishes to do battle with a Supreme Being must have a certain degree of strength. A sling bullet like that was nothing more than an insult to you!" "Haha, so, that means Nigun and his lackeys fail the test, then?"
