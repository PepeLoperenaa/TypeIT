Still, the time spent here had not been wasted. In particular, the more he learned about this world, the more he realised he did not know. It was enough that he was aware of his ignorance. As Ainz watched the magnificent sunset, he thought about what he needed to do. It was dangerous to move around in this world when he did not understand anything about it. Ideally, he should finish gathering information and then begin acting in this world under a false identity. Although, after saving this village, hiding his identity was impossible. Even if the knights were exterminated, their parent country would unearth the truth. Much like in the previous world where forensic science was welldeveloped, this new world might have its own ways of finding out the truth, and they might be very efficient in doing so. Also, even if they made no investigation, as long as the villagers survived, someone would eventually follow the trail back to Ainz. To prevent a leak, he could take them all into the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. However, the country that these villagers belonged to would not take that lying down, and they might even treat it as a kidnapping. Therefore, he had stated his name, and let the knights flee. There were two reasons for that. The first reason was that news about Ainz would get around as long as he did not hole up in Nazarick. Therefore, it would be better if he controlled how the information got out. The second was because he wanted to spread the word that Ainz Ooal Gown saved a village and slew the knights. In particular, he wanted to let any players from YGGDRASIL hear about it. Ainz planned to take up residence in either the Kingdom, the Empire or the Theocracy.
