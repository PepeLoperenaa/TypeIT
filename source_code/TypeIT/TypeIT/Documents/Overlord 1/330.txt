"There may be many heroes, but we will surpass each and every one of them. We will let everybody in this world know that Ainz Ooal Gown are the true heroes! If there are people stronger than us, we will deal with them in ways other than force. If we encounter a magician with many subordinates, we will achieve our goal some other way. This is merely the preparatory phase in order to let everyone know that Ainz Ooal Gown is the greatest. Let us fight together for this glorious future!" He would spread this name throughout the world. The former members of Ainz Ooal Gown may have left YGGDRASIL, but there was a chance they might be in this world, like Ainz. Therefore, he had to make Ainz Ooal Gown a legend, so everyone would know of it. Be it in the air, land or sea, he would spread this name to all the sapient beings in this world. He would carry this name to the ears of his comrades who might be in this world. Ainz's fearsome presence was startling, and his thunderous voice could be heard anywhere in the Throne Room. Their voices united as one, everyone in the Throne Room lowered their heads. The sound they made might have been taken for a prayer.    The throne was vacant after its master left, but the air in the Throne Room still boiled with excitement.
