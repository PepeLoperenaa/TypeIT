"Exit the Tomb and investigate the surrounding region. If you encounter intelligent creatures, interact peacefully with them and invite them to the Tomb. Attempt to accommodate the other party as much as possible during negotiations. Do not stray more than one kilometer from the tomb and avoid unnecessary combat." "Understood, Momonga-sama. I will do so immediately." In YGGDRASIL, NPCs made to protect a guild base could not leave it under any circumstances. However, it would seem this ironclad restriction had been overturned. No, he could only be certain of that once Sebas returned. "...Select one of the Pleiades to accompany you. If battle begins, retreat immediately and convey everything you have learned." That was simply the first step. Momonga let go of the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. The staff did not fall onto the ground, but floated in the air as though someone were still holding it. This was in complete defiance of physics, but it was a common sight in the game. There were quite a few items in YGGDRASIL which would continue floating in the air when left unattended. The aura of tormented spirits seemed to cling to Momonga's hand as he let the staff go, but Momonga paid it no heed. He was long since used to that sight...or not, but because he thought huge orders like these would not be unusual, Momonga deactivated the aura with a wave of his fingers. Momonga grabbed his head in both hands. The next step would be- "...I should contact the game company." The game company would know the most about Momonga's present situation.
