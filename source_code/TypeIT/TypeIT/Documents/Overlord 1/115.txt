and his summoned creature he ordered the Primal Fire Elemental to attack the twins. As the conflagration that was the Primal Fire Elemental approached them the twins met its attack with Aura as the frontliner while Mare was the rear guard. Aura slashed at the Primal Fire Elemental holding her whip in both her hands while Mare used magic to deal damage. "Well it seems it'll be an easy fight." Momonga's eyes left the onesided battle which was taking place and began to ponder the other things he needed to investigate. He had already finished verifying that he could use and activate his spells and equipped magic items. Thus the next things he had to check on were his other items. Scrolls wands and rods were particularly important. All of them were magic items that could produce a spelllike effect. Scrolls were oneuse expendables while rods and wands had charges which they consumed to produce Their effects. Momonga possessed many magic items. He was a hoarder by nature and did not like using expendable items because he felt it was a waste to the point where he did not even feel like using highend recovery items when he encountered a boss. This went beyond mere prudence to miserliness which was why his stock of items was so great. In YGGDRASIL all of these were stored in his personal inventory. Then in this world where had his inventory and all its contents gone Momonga recalled how he had opened his inventory in the past and reached his hand into the air as though searching for something. It felt as though he was reaching his hand past the surface of a lake and an observer would think that Momonga's hand and part of his arm had vanished into nothingness. Then like he was opening a window Momonga swept his hand to one side. A hole appeared out of nowhere and within it were many beautifullycrafted magic staves. It was exactly like the inventory in YGGDRASIL.
