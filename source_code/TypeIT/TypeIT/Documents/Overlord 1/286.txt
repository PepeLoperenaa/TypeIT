Nigun had no idea what Ainz was talking about and his ire was rising. He asked "That's enough of your selfabsorbed prattle. Now tell me where is Stronoff" "I teleported him to the village." "...What" Nigun had not expected Ainz to answer. He thought of why Ainz would say that and replied "How foolish. Even if you tell a lie like that a quick search of the village will" "It is not a lie. I merely answered your question. Well there is another reason for why I answered your question." "...Could it be that you want to beg for mercy If you help us save some time I can consider it." "Nonono... well... the truth is I overheard your conversation with the WarriorCaptain. What a lot of nerve you have." Ainz's tone changed suddenly and he continued speaking as he looked at the mocking Nigun. "To think you would dare say that you would massacre the villagers that I Ainz Ooal Gown took the time to personally rescue. I cannot think of anything that is more offensive than that." Ainz's robe rippled in the wind. That same wind blew across Nigun and company.
