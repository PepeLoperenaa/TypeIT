Why had Bukubukuchagamasan who had designed Mare dressed him like this Was it to dress him differently from Aura or was there another reason Just as Momonga was pondering this question Mare asked a question of his own. "Ah excuse me Momongasama... but why are you dressed like that" "...Ah about that..." Because I wanted to get away  obviously he could not say that. Mare's eyes sparkled as he looked up to the troubled Momonga . How should he bluff his way through this If he failed here all the acting he had done to appear like a commanding superior would have gone to waste. No subordinate would respect a superior who was trying to flee. Momonga desperately tried to calm himself down and then help came from an unexpected quarter. "That's simple Mare." Momonga looked back and his eyes were instantly drawn to the person he was looking at. A woman who seemed to be the embodiment of all feminine beauty stood beneath the moonlight. The bluishwhite radiance played across her body which sparkled in response. It was as though a goddess had descended from the heavens to grace the earth. Her black wings flapped creating a gust of wind. It was Albedo. Although Demiurge was behind her such was Albedo's beauty that Momonga's eyes did not even register Demiurge's form.
