As he turned to look at the voice's origin, he saw a heteromorphic being shrouded in chilled air. It stood two and a half meters tall, and resembled a bipedal insect. It looked like some fiend had melded a praying mantis and an ant together. It had a tail that was twice as long as its body, and it was covered in sharp spikes which resembled icicles. Its powerful-looking mandibles looked like they could sever a man's arm in a single bite. It grasped a platinum halberd in two of its hands, and in its other two hands were a masterfully-made mace wreathed in a black aura, and a gnarledlooking broadsword which did not look like it could be sheathed. It was surrounded by a frightening aura of cold. Its exoskeleton was a dull blue color and sparkled like diamond dust. Protrusions which looked like icebergs bulged up from its back and shoulders. He was the Guardian of the Fifth Floor, the "Ruler of Glaciers", Cocytus. The hilt of his halberd slammed into the arena floor, and the ground around it began to freeze. "You. Stand. Before. A. Supreme. Being. Contain. Yourself." "This brat started it!" "Actually-" "Awawawa..." Shalltear and Aura locked gazes, while Mare panicked from the side. Momonga could not hold it in any longer, and curtly addressed the two of them. "...Shalltear, Aura. Playtime is over." The two of them shuddered in shock, then lowered their heads simultaneously.
