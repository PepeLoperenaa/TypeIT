"Oh? Really? Well, if you feel that way..." "Now is good! It's the best!" "Then we'll leave it at that." Momonga was taken somewhat aback by Aura's passionate answer. "Mo-Momonga-sama, are we the only ones that you're nice to...?" Momonga was unsure how to answer Aura's muttered question. Instead, he patted her lightly on the head. "Ehehehe." Aura looked like a puppy that had just seen something she liked, while Mare had a jealous look on his face. Just then, a voice rang out: "Oya, am I the first to arrive?" The tone was archaic and formal, but the voice itself sounded like it belonged to a young person. A shadow formed over the ground, and then the shadow turned into what looked like a door, from which a person emerged. She wore a black ballgown which looked soft to the touch. Her skirt was puffed up into a voluminous bell shape. On top of that was a bolero edged with frills, lace and ribbons, as well as a pair of long silk gloves. Together, they covered up most of her skin. Her skin was as pale as wax, and her looks could only be described as stunningly beautiful. Her long silver hair was tied up into a ponytail that descended from one side of her head, exposing her face. Her deep red pupils were filled with a seductive look of delight. She looked to be 14 years old, or younger, and her innocent, youthful appearance combined the qualities of cuteness and beauty into a single whole. However, her breasts bulged proudly forward in a decidedly unchildlike manner.
