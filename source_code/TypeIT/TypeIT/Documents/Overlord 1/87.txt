this, but first he needed to collect information and establish his priorities. Thus, putting this matter aside would be a wise decision. After all, Momonga still had many doubts about how the YGGDRASIL he knew had changed. Aura was still scolding Mare as Momonga stood in contemplation. Momonga pitied Mare a little. After all, he had not said anything that warranted such wrathful castigation. In the past, when brother and sister argued, all Momonga could do was watch. But now, things were different. "That should be enough, don't you think?" "Momonga-sama! But, but as a Guardian, Mare-" "It's fine. Aura, I understand how you feel. It is only natural that you would feel unhappy if Mare, as a Floor Guardian, said such a cowardly thing, especially if it were in my presence. However, I believe that if anyone invaded the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, you and Mare would fearlessly step forward to engage them. There is no need for scoldings as long as one does what is required of them when the time comes." Momonga walked up to between the two of them and helped Mare up. "And Mare, you should be grateful to your kind sister. Even if I were angry, I could not remain so after seeing how your sister scolded you." Mare looked in surprise at his sister. At this moment, Aura hurriedly said: "Eh? No, no, it's not like that. I wasn't scolding him to show off in front of Momonga-sama!" "Aura, it's fine. It doesn't matter what you had in mind. I understand your kind intentions. However, I must tell you that I am not dissatisfied with Mare's performance as a Guardian." "Um, ah, yes, yes! Thank you, Momonga-sama!"
