However could those members of the Black Scripture take care of all these angels with just one spell Nigun shook his head to clear away his doubts. He could not think of that question. If he got his answer then he would truly be done for. Therefore Nigun reached inside his coat and touched the item within to give himself courage. He fervently believed that as long as he held it everything would be fine. However his subordinates did not have the same source of moral support that he did. "Uuwaaaah" "What what the hell" "It's a monster" Once they realized their angels were useless they wailed and fell back upon the spells that they knew and trusted. "Charm Person Iron Hammer of Righteousness Hold Fire Rain Emerald Sarcophagus Holy Ray Shockwave Confusion Charge of Stalagmite Open Wounds Poison Fear Word of Curse Blindness..." All kinds of spells rained down on Ainz. Yet even as the storm of magic lashed against him Ainz was unmoved. "Well all of these are familiar spells...who taught them to you The Slaine Theocracy Someone else There are more and more things I want to ask you now."
