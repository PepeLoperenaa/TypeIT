one who had started the guild and the one who had gathered the "Original Nine". "Touch Me." The symbol on the next flag he pointed to belonged to the oldest member of Ainz Ooal Gown who was a lecturer in a university in real life. "Shijuuten Suzaku." His finger moved faster than before as he shifted to the flag which belonged to one of the three female members of Ainz Ooal Gown. "Ankoro Mochimochi." Momonga fluidly recited the names of the various symbols' owners "Herohero Peroroncino Bukubukuchagama Tabula Smaragdina Warrior Takemikazuchi Variable Talisman Genjiro" It did not take long for him to name all 40 of his former comrades. Their names were still branded deeply in Momonga's brain. He sprawled tiredly on the throne. "Yeah it really was fun..." Even though the game did not have any subscription fees Momonga had still spent a third of his monthly salary on it. It was not because his salary was high but because he had no other hobbies so he funnelled all his income into YGGDRASIL. There was a cash gacha in the game where players could pay for a chance to win a prize. Momonga spent nearly his entire bonus on it and barely managed to get a rare item out of the experience. When he heard that one of his guild members Yamaiko had won that item for the cost of a lunch Momonga was so filled with jealousy that he wanted to roll around on the ground.
