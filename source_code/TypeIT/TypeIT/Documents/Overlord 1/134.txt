"There is no need. Sebas is currently reconnoitering the surface." Surprise flashed across the faces of Albedo and the other Guardians. In the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, there were four NPCs who were exponents of melee combat. Cocytus had the strongest attack power when using a weapon, Albedo had an impregnable defense when in her heavy armor, while Sebas in his true form was stronger than either of them two in melee combat. And then was one more, who was superior to all of them. There could be no other reason for the Guardians' surprise. Sebas, who could sweep away anyone before him in hand-to-hand combat, had been assigned to the simple task of reconnaissance. They could tell how seriously Momonga was taking this strange occurrence, and everyone was on their guard as a result. "It's about time for him to return." Just then, Momonga saw Sebas jogging over to them, until he reached the Guardians genuflecting before Momonga and went to one knee as well. "Momonga-sama, forgive my lateness." "It's fine. Then, your report on the surrounding conditions." Sebas raised his head and looked around at the Guardians kneeling beside him. "...The situation is critical, so obviously the Floor Guardians would need to know as well." "Yes. To begin with, the terrain surrounding us for a kilometer in each direction is a plain. There are no signs of man-made structures. I spotted some small animals, but there were no humanoid or large creatures." "Were those small animals monsters?" "No, they were life-forms which had no combat power."
