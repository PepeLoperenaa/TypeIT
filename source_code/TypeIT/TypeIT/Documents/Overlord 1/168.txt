maintaining public order, as well as all the other problems that came with ruling a host of nations. When one thought about these things, one would realise that there was hardly any point in conquering the world. Momonga knew all of this, but he still spoke of conquering this world, because seeing its beauty awoke that juvenile desire within him. In addition, as he was getting into the mindset of being the leader of the dreaded guild Ainz Ooal Gown, those words accidentally fell from his mouth. And there was one more reason. "...Ulbert-san, LuciFer-san, Variable Talisman-san, Bellriver-san..." It was because he remembered what his former guildmates had once said, "Let's conquer one of the worlds in YGGDRASIL." He knew that Demiurge, the wisest mind in Nazarick, would understand that taking over the world was just a child's joke. If Momonga had seen the smile that had spread across Demiurge's frog-face, he would surely not have left matters at that. But Momonga did not look at Demiurge, instead turning his gaze to the horizon where the infinite expanse of the earth and sky met. "...This is an unknown world. But am I the only one who made it here? Did the other members of the guild come here too?" Although one could not play multiple characters in YGGDRASIL, his comrades who left might have made new characters on the last day of the game. Also, given that he had been online so close to the forced logoff time, Herohero-san might have come here too. The fact was, Momonga's presence here was an anomaly. The unknown circumstances that had brought him here might have brought his comrades who no longer played the game here with him.
