Momonga muttered to himself as he operated his player console. He intended to equip himself in the gear that best suited the leader of a toptier guild. YGGDRASIL's equipment was classified according to how much data each item possessed. Items with more data were ranked higher. From the lowest to the highest rank they were lowclass middleclass highclass topclass legacyclass relicclass legendaryclass and what Momonga was currently selecting divineclass. On his ten bony fingers he wore nine rings each with a different ability. Then there was the matter of his necklace his gloves his cape his shirt and his circlet all of which were divineclass items as well. If they had a price it would be a jawdropping one. The flowing robe which covered his torso was grander than the one he had worn earlier. A red and black aura rose slowly from beneath his feet and at a glance it seemed extremely ominous. This aura was not the result of any skill Momonga activated. It was simply because there had been extra room in the robe's data capacity so the special effects data for a Disaster Aura had been added into it. Touching that aura would not cause any harm. In the corner of Momonga's vision he could see various indicators which showed his stats increasing. After changing out his gear the fullyequipped Momonga nodded satisfied that he looked the part of the guild's leader. Then he reached out and grasped the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. As Momonga grasped the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown it radiated a nimbus of reddishblack light. Tormented faces occasionally coalesced out of the roiling light and then they crumbled and vanished again. They looked so realistic one could almost imagine them wailing in agony. "...I wonder if they went overboard with the details."
