After Gazef gave his orders, he turned a keen glare at the angel which had escaped with its life. It had been badly hurt, but it was still trying to find holes in Gazef's defenses. "So that's how it is." A strange feeling ran up his arms when his blade found its mark. Gazef knew what it was. These monsters had a skill that would greatly reduce any damage done to them unless the attacking weapon was made of a special material. It was thanks to this ability that the angel could take a blow from Gazef without falling. If that was the case... Gazef focused his energies within himself and activated the martial art [Focus Battle Aura], and his blade glowed with a crimson light. The angel took this opportunity to cut in with a sword of red flame. However - "-Too slow." In the eyes of the Kingdom's strongest warrior, Gazef Stronoff, the angel's movements were truly too slow. Gazef's sword moved. This blow was far more powerful than the one before it, and Gazef's sword sheared neatly through the angel's body. Its body destroyed, the Angel seemed to melt in mid-air, its glittering wings flapping a few times before vanishing as though it had been nothing more than an illusion. If Gazef had not been in such dire straits, he might well have applauded the light show. However, he did not have the time for that at the moment.
