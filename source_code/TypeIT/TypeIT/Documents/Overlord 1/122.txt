"...Weren't you told not to frivolously use Gate in Nazarick We are teleportationwarded after all. You should be able to walk here so shouldn't you have come on foot Shalltear" The annoyed voice came from beside Momonga. There was no trace of its previous puppylike obedience in those cold words only a burning hostility. Mare was trembling by the side and he slowly edged himself away from his sister. In truth the speed at which the leopard called Aura had changed its spots startled Momonga as well. The girl who had come here via the highest tier of teleportation magic was called Shalltear. She did not even bother looking at Aura who was scowling at her. Instead she swiftly advanced before Momonga. The bewitching scent of some kind of perfume hung around her. "...Something stinks" Aura spat. Then she followed up with "Don't tell me you started rotting because you're undead" Perhaps she saw Momonga reflexively raising his hand to sniff himself but Shalltear furrowed her brows unhappily and replied "...Is that not quite distasteful Momongasama is undead as well." "Hah What nonsense are you talking Shalltear Momongasama is no mere undead being. He's more like a super undead or a godly undead." Momonga was somewhat baffled as he heard Shalltear and Mare going "Ah" and "Mm" respectively. The fact was that in YGGDRASIL he considered himself to be an ordinary undead creature... which was what Momonga thought as he rounded his shoulders. In any case there were no such things as super or godly undead. "But but neechan maybe you shouldn't have said that..." "Is is that so All right then ah take two then. Ahem... Don't tell me you started rotting because you're a walking corpse."
