This square was at the center of the village where Londes and his men had gathered 60 or so villagers. They looked fearfully at Londes and his men while a group of children were hiding behind a wooden watchtower. Some of the children held sticks but none of them was in a fighting stance. It was all they could do not to drop their sticks. During Londes' attack on the village they had chased the villagers to the central square. They searched the houses and then to root out anyone who was hiding in the cellars they poured in alchemical oils and set them on fire. There were four knights standing guard around the village with bows and their job was to shoot down anyone who tried to escape the village. They had done this several times now and it could be said that they were old hands at this sort of thing. The massacre had taken a fair bit of time but it had been successful and they had gathered the surviving villagers into one place. After that they would release some of the prisoners as bait. It should have been like that but Londes still remembered that moment. The sight of Erion flying through the air after the last few villagers fled into the square. It should have been impossible. Nobody knew what was going on. How could they understand the reason why a trained grown man in full plate armor  which still had some weight even if it was lightened by magic  could fly through the air like a ball After soaring about seven meters through the air he fell to the earth with a thunderous crash and lay still. A bonechilling monster stood where Erion had been. The hairraising undead being called a "Death Knight" lowered the tower shield that had bashed Erion and stood before them. This was when their despair began.
