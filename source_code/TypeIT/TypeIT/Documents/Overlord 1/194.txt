Momonga had been planning to follow up with another spell but he felt silly as he noted the weakness of the knights. "Pathetic... he died so easily..." To Momonga the 5thtier Dragon Lightning was a weak spell. When hunting level 100 players Momonga would usually cast spells of the 8th tier and higher. Magic of the 5th tier and below would almost never see use.  Now that he knew the knights were weak enough to be finished off by 5thtier magic Momonga's tension vanished in an instant. Of course it could be that these two knights were especially weak among their kind but still it was a great relief. Still the plan to retreat with magic had not changed. These knights might be focused on offense. In YGGDRASIL a blow to the neck counted as a critical hit and dealt extra damage but in the real world it might well be fatal. Instead of relaxing Momonga raised his guard. It would be too foolish to die because he was careless. Next he ought to continue testing his powers. Momonga activated one of his skills. "Create MidTier Undead Death Knight." This was one of Momonga's skills which could create various undead. The Death Knight in question was Momonga's favorite undead monster which he used as a meat shield. It was roughly level 35 but although its attack power was only comparable to a level 25 monster its defensive power was very good equivalent to a level 40 monster. That said monsters of that level were useless to Momonga for the most part. However the Death Knight had two very important skills. One of them was the ability to draw away enemy attacks. The other was that just once they could survive any attack with 1 HP. Momonga liked using Death Knights as shields because of these two skills.
