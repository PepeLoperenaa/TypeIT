Gazef could only listen quietly as his Vice-Captain got more and more nervous. "If we won't fall back... then we should leave the survivors behind and launch a pursuit with all of us." "That would be the wisest option.... But at the same time, it would mean that we would be leaving them to their deaths. Do you think they can survive by themselves?" The Vice-Captain could not reply, because he knew the survivors' chances by themselves were practically nonexistent. Without someone to protect and escort them to a safe area, they would be dead in days. Even so, the Vice-Captain spoke - no, he had to speak. "...Warrior-Captain. Yours is the most valuable life here. The villagers' lives are nothing in comparison." Gazef was well aware of the painful decision the Vice-Captain had made, and he was angry at himself for having forced him to say such a thing. Even so, he could not comply with the Vice-Captain's request. "I was born a commoner, and so were you." "Indeed, and I enlisted in admiration of you, Warrior-Captain." "I recall you were born in a village as well?" "Yes, which is why..." "Life in a village is difficult, and death is a constant companion. It's not uncommon for a village to be attacked by a monster and many lives lost as a result, am I wrong?" "...No, you are not."
