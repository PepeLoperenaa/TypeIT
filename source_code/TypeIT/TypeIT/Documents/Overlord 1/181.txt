Enri forcefully punched the knight's metal helmet. That strike carried the anger that filled her and the desire to protect her little sister. She did not care that she was striking metal with her bare hand. She hit him with every ounce of her strength. There was the sound of something like bones cracking and soon pain spread throughout Enri's body. The knight wobbled under the force of the mighty blow. "Hurry" "Yes" Enri bit back the pain and made to flee again  and suddenly a line of scorching heat bloomed on her back. "Ggk" "Damn you" The village girl punching the knight in the face had shamed him hence his anger. He was swinging his sword wildly having lost his cool. As a result his first blow did not cause a mortal wound. However that was the end of her luck. Enri was hurt and the knight was filled with rage. The next blow would certainly take her life. Enri looked at the longsword raised high before her. Panic was written all over her face as she watched the malevolent gleaming of the terrible swift sword and she realized two things. The first was that her life would be over in a few seconds. The second was that an ordinary village girl like herself had no way of fighting that fate. The tip of the sword was stained with some of her blood. As her heart beat faster the pain spread through her body along with the scorching heat of her wound.
