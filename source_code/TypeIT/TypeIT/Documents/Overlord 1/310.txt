The kings of the mighty draconic races  the Dragon Lords. The legendary monster who could destroy an entire country  Landfall. And one more  the Demon Gods. He had heard that the Thirteen Heroes had defeated and sealed away the Demon Gods. Judging by that wave of evil from just now that must have been a Demon God about to break its seal. At the same time Nigun had the faint hope that if they were Demon Gods then Dominion Authority might still have a chance to win. "One more time Use 'Holy Smite'" Ainz said that the spell had hurt. That meant that he had been injured. It might mean that he had trouble just standing up. Countless "mights" popped up in Nigun's mind. Without them he would go mad. However Ainz would not permit a second attack. "...Now it's my turn... know despair. Black Hole"  A small point appeared on Dominion Authority's shining body. It slowly enlarged into a yawning black void. The black hole swallowed everything. It was so underwhelming that it made them stare in dumbfounded silence. It might even be laughable. But they could no longer see it.
