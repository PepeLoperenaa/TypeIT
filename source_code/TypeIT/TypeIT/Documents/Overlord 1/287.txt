The cold wind just happened to be blowing from Ainz's direction but Nigun hurriedly brushed away the phantom image that loomed in front of him. Yes that vision of death before him must have been an illusion. "...What what do you mean by 'offensive' magic caster What of it" Although he was obviously frightened Nigun did not change his mocking tone. He was the commander of one of the Slaine Theocracy's secret weapons the Sunlight Scripture. How could he be afraid of a single man's name It was impossible. It could not be possible. Yet "I mentioned a deal earlier. These are the terms. You will hand your lives over to me without resistance. In exchange you will not have to suffer. However if you put up a fight then the price you fools shall pay is to die in despair and agony." Ainz took a step forward. It was just a single step but Ainz's body seemed to swell massively before their eyes. Cowed by him the men of the Sunlight Scripture reflexively took a step back. "Ahh..." Several hoarse cries came from around Nigun. They were cries of fear. His presence was filled with an unimaginable power. This was the first time Nigun had been faced with such might. Therefore he could understand his men's fear.
