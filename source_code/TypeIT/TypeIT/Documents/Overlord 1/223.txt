A surge of pride came over Ainz as the villagers asked about the Staff which he and his guildmates had painstakingly crafted. However, his delight was immediately suppressed to normal levels, which made Ainz furrow his nonexistent brows. Frankly speaking, Ainz disliked this forced calming effect. That said, it was also true that allowing his emotions to run wild would make it difficult to solve the challenges ahead of him. With that in mind, Ainz prepared himself for his upcoming task. He had to negotiate payment for rescuing the village with the chief. Of course, Ainz's real objective was to obtain information, and not money. However, directly asking for information would be strange. While it would be fine in a small village like this, once the local lords found out, they would begin making their way to him. When they discovered that he knew nothing about this world, there was a high chance that they would try to use him. Was he being too cautious about this? Ainz felt that this was like running across a busy road - a fatal accident could happen at any time. The fatal accident in this case meant encountering the mighty beings of this world. Strength and weakness were two sides of the same coin. For now, Ainz was stronger than everyone he had encountered in this village. However, that did not guarantee that he was stronger than everyone in this world. In addition, Ainz was now undead, and from the terrified reaction of the two girls, he could imagine that undead were not very well-received in this world. He had to be aware that since most humans would hate him, they might well attack him. Thus, he had to tread very carefully. "Sorry to keep you waiting." -The chief sat opposite Ainz. His wife stood behind him.
