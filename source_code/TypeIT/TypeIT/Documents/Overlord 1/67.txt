To Momonga who wielded the power of an Overlord it was as simple and natural as breathing. He could not help but laugh at the strange situation he found himself in. After all the shocks and surprises he had received so far this was hardly worth panicking about. It was frightening how well he had adapted to his condition. "I'm going to touch you." "Ah." After deactivating the skill he touched Albedo's hand. Thoughts like "her hand's so slim" "her skin's so white" and so on raced through his head but he cast aside these male desires and focused on one thing  the pulse at her wrist.  It was there. It was a steady rhythm lubdub lubdub. She was a living being so it was only natural. Yes she was alive. Momonga released her hand and looked at his own arms. All he saw was an expanse of polished white bone bereft of skin or flesh. Because he had no blood vessels he could not feel a heartbeat. Indeed an Overlord was an undead creature a being that had transcended mortality itself so obviously it would not have a heartbeat. He shifted his gaze to Albedo. Momonga saw himself reflected within Albedo's moist golden eyes. Her cheeks were pink probably because her body was rapidly heating up. The changes in her body surprised him. "...What's this"
