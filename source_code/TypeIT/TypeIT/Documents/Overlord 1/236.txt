Slaine Theocracy. There were other countries but the chief only knew of these three. The chief was not sure where exactly this village was placed between the three of them. In other words  "...How foolish of me." The knights from just now were wearing armor emblazoned with the insignia of the Baharuth Empire so the chief believed that they were from the Baharuth Empire. But this area also bordered the Slaine Theocracy so they might have been knights from that country in disguise. Releasing them all was a mistake. He should have kept one for questioning but it was too late for that now. If this was the work of the Slaine Theocracy then he should probably do something on the Empire's side. On the Kingdom's side he should have accumulated enough goodwill with them for rescuing their village so things should be fine for now. Ainz sank into thought. Was he the only one who had come to this world Impossible. There was a very high chance other players had come here too. Perhaps Heroherosan was here as well. He needed to think about what would happen if he encountered other players. If other players had come to this world they would probably gather up given the nature of Japanese people. When the time came he had to do almost anything to blend in. He could give in to anything as long as it did not involve Ainz Ooal Gown. The problem was what would happen if the other side considered him an obstacle. The possibility was slight but it could not be discounted.
