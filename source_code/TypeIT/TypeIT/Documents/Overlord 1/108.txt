He was not sure, but he had a faint idea of how to use his magic. It was a power hidden within him. Just like how he had deactivated his negative touch, Momonga focused within himself. An icon appeared, as though floating in mid-air- And Ainz smiled in delight. He was fully aware of information like the spell's effective radius, its recast delay, and so on. Knowing this information, being sure of his power filled him with a surging excitement and warm satisfaction. Unlike in YGGDRASIL, he felt that the magic was part of him. This was a satisfaction he could never have experienced in YGGDRASIL. He channelled the jubilation in his heart - although his mood calmed quickly, he could still feel joy and excitement - into his fingertip, and spoke the words: " [Fireball]." An expanding globe of flame shot out from the finger pointing at the strawman. The fireball struck the strawman unerringly, as he had predicted. It burst, releasing a wave of scorching flame that blew the strawman away. The inner part of the fireball exploded, turning the strawman and the surrounding area into a sea of fire. All this happened in an instant. Then, besides the blackened strawman, there was nothing left. "Fufufufu..." Aura and Mare watched Momonga snicker, clueless as to what was going on. "-Aura, set up another strawman." "Ah, yes, at once! Hurry up and do it!"
