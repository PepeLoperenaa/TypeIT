The girl forgot to breathe as if the sight had stolen her soul away. Then in this silent world the girl began choking and gasped for air. This avatar of death must have manifested itself in order to guide her to the underworld. It was only natural to think so. But then the girl who thought this way suddenly realized that something was wrong. That was because the knight who had been planning to kill her from behind was now completely still. "Gaaah..." A cry that sounded like a wail crept into her ears. From whose mouth had that sound come It felt like it could have been hers or her little sister shivering in fright or from the mouth of the knight that had been about to kill her. A skeletal hand slowly extended itself  its fingers spreading as though reaching for something and they moved past the girl toward the knight behind her. She wanted to look away from it but fear kept her gaze in place. She had the feeling that if she averted her eyes she would see a far more horrible sight instead. "Grasp Heart." The incarnation of death clenched its fist and the girl heard the sound of crunching metal from behind her. Her eyes did not leave the figure of Death but driven by her curiosity the girl wrenched her eyes away and saw the body of the knight. He was sprawled motionless on the floor like a puppet whose strings had been cut. He was dead. There was no doubt that he was dead.
