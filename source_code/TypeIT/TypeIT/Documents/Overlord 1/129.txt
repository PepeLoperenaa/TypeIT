"I see." "...My. Allies. Have. Not. Arrived. Yet." Aura and Shalltear froze as they heard those words and the smile froze on Albedo's face. "...That that fellow is just an Area Guardian in one of the floors which I... which we are in charge of." "Yyes..." Shalltear and Aura smiled stiffly while Albedo nodded vigorously in agreement. "...Kyouhukou is it. Indeed it would be good to inform the various Area Guardians. Then let the Area Guardians like Guren and Grant know about it as well. I will leave that task to the various Floor Guardians." There were two kinds of Guardians in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. Floor Guardians like the ones before Momonga at the moment were responsible for one or more floors. Area Guardians were responsible for an individual area within a floor. Simply put the Floor Guardians were in charge of the Area Guardians who were in turn in charge of a specific domain. Since there were many of them they were individually not very important. In Nazarick the term Guardian usually referred to a Floor Guardian. After the various Floor Guardians showed that they understood Momonga's orders Albedo commanded "Then everyone let us pledge our loyalty to the Supreme One." All the Guardians nodded as one and before Momonga could interrupt they had lined up before him. Albedo stood at their head while the other Guardians formed a line behind her. All the Guardians had solemn respectful expressions. They showed no sign of playing around.
