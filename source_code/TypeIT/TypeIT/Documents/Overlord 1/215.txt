"As expected of an undead being that Ainzsama made. His marvellous execution of his duties is truly praiseworthy. The undead made by Ainz's magic and his skills were stronger than ordinary monsters of their kind due to Ainz's class skills. Naturally the same applied to the Death Knight he had just created. However it was only a level 35 monster and it was nothing in comparison to the monsters which required XP to create like Overlord Wiseman and Grim Reaper Thanatos. The fact that it was still fighting until now meant that the enemies were weak. In other words there was no danger. He wanted to jump for joy when he thought about it but he had to okay the role of the dignified master so Ainz quashed that thought. However he clenched his fists tightly under his robe. "The enemies who attacked the village were too weak. Then let us go check on the survivors." Before Momonga set out he realised that he had some things to do first. To begin with he deactivated the special effects of the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. The malevolent aura which wreathed it vanished like a candle flame in the wind. Next he withdrew a fullface mask from his inventory. It was gaudily decorated and its expression was hard to describe being somewhere between crying and anger. It resembled a Balinese barong mask. The mask looked creepy but it had no special powers. It was a simple cosmetic item which did not contain a trace of data. Only those who were logged onto YGGDRASIL for more than two hours between 1900 to 2200 on Christmas Eve would have this mask  no as long as they were in the game during that period of time they would automatically receive it. It could be called a cursed item.
