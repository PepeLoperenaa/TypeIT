choices. As he did so the names of the butlers and maids appeared over their heads. "I see. So that's what they were called." Momonga laughed softly at himself for forgetting their names and also because of the fond memories they brought up in him. There had been quite a few arguments between his colleagues when they had chosen names for the NPCs. The butler  Sebas'  design was that of a house steward. The six maids beside him were combat maids loyal to Sebas. Together they were called the "Pleiades". In addition to these maids Sebas was also in charge of the Tomb's manservants. The text box for Sebas contained more detailed information but Momonga did not feel like reading it. The servers would shut down soon and he had to go somewhere before then. As an aside all the NPCs apart from the maids were also very well detailed. This was because the guild members were all fans of complex backstories and details. Many of the guild members were artists and programmers and a game like this which emphasized the customization of appearances  allowing them to indulge their desire to create and design  was a godsend to them. Originally Sebas and the combat maids were intended to be a last line of defense against invaders. However if enemy players could penetrate this deeply into the tomb they would be able to handily defeat Sebas and the maids so they were little more than speedbumps to buy time. However no player had ever made it this far so they had been waiting here for orders. Without orders all they could do was wait for a chance to be of use. Momonga tightened his grip on the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. He knew it was foolish to feel pity for NPCs. They were nothing more than a collection of electronic data and the closest they could come to real emotion was a very skilled set of AI routines.
