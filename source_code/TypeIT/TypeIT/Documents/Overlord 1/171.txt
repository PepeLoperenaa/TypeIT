Mare ran over with a tatata sound as Momonga landed upon the ground. The hem of Mare's skirt fluttered around his thighs as his legs pumped up and down. For a moment, something peeked out from below, then vanished again... no, Momonga was not interested in looking under Mare's skirt. He was just curious about what he wore underneath it. "Mo-Momonga-sama, w-welcome ." "Mm... Mare, there is no need to be nervous. Take your time and go slowly. If you're not used to it, you can also dispense with the polite language... though only when we're in private, of course." "I, I can't do that, how could I not speak respectfully to a Supreme Being... actually, Nee-chan shouldn't be doing that too. It, it's terribly rude..." Although he disliked children being so formal around him, Momonga said: "I see, Mare. Well, if you insist, then I am fine with it. However, I want you to know that I will not force you to do so." "Y-yes! ...al-although, may I ask why you came here, Momonga-sama? Did I make a mistake...?" "Of course not, Mare. In fact, I came here to praise you." The expression on Mare's face went from fear that he might be scolded to surprise. "Mare, your work is very important. Even with our security net in place, the inhabitants of this world may be over level 100. If we are faced with opponents like that, concealing the Great Tomb of Nazarick will be our top priority.." Mare nodded furiously in agreement.
