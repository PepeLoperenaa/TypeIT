The sound of grass rustling in the wind was annoying too. His heartbeat sounded especially loud. He was breathing heavily like he had been running for a long time. Words of reassurance began appearing in his head. However the sight of Ainz being stabbed with swords as well as his mass slaughter of angels with just one spell were telling Nigun something else. That is a monster beyond my wildest imaginings. I could never hope to defeat it. "CapCaptain what what should we do..." "Figure it out yourself I'm not your mother" Nigun only managed to calm down after he could no longer see the face of the man he was shouting at. Losing his cool in front of an unknown monster like this was a very bad thing. The sun was slowly falling below the horizon and darkness threatened to swallow the world. It felt like Death itself was opening its maw to devour everything. Nigun tried to force his fear back and gave an order "Protect me Protect me if you want to live" Nigun brought the crystal out in his trembling hand. His subordinates usually vigorous and nimble were chained down by fear and their movements were slow. Even these fearless men would hesitate when ordered to become a shield against a monster like the one which stood before them. However he had to have them buy him some time no matter what.
