Momonga swallowed with a nonexistent throat. Though his mind could not comprehend the situation, his heart could. His hands finally left Albedo's ample bosom. He realised that he had been groping her for a long time, but Momonga justified it to himself by saying that he had no choice but to grope her for that long, and it was definitely not because squeezing her supple flesh felt so good that he reluctantly let go of her... or something. "Sorry, Albedo." "Fuahh..." A sensual moan came from the red-faced Albedo, and he could practically feel her body heat raising the surrounding temperature. After that, she shyly asked Momonga: "Will I have my first time here?" Momonga was caught off guard by her question, and before he could think clearly, he replied: "...Eh?" His mind was suddenly frozen, and was unable to parse her question, First time? What's that? What's this all about? And why does she look so shy? "May I ask how you wish to dispose of my clothes?" "...Wha?" "Would it be better if I disrobed myself? Or would you like to unwrap me, Momonga-sama? Or if we did it while I was wearing the dress, afterwards... it would get dirty... no, if you want me to wear this dress, I have no objections, Momonga-sama."
