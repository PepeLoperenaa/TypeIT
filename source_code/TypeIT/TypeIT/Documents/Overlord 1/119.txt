Momonga then took out a pair of beautiful glasses, filled them with water from the Pitcher, and gave them to the twins. "Aura, Mare, have a drink." "Eh? But that's not good, right, Momonga-sama..." "Y-yes, I can make water with my magic too..." Momonga smiled bitterly as he saw Aura waving her hand and Mare shaking his head. "Think nothing of it. The two of you have always done well. Think of this as my thanks to you." "Fuwa" "Fuee" Aura and Mare's ears turned red, and they shyly, nervously reached out to take the glasses. "Th-thank you, Momonga-sama!" "To, to think you would pour water for us, Momonga-sama!" Was this so delightful? Aura, who had ceased her protests, took the glass in both hands and downed it in one gulp. Droplets of water escaped the corner of her mouth, down the smooth curves of her pulsing throat and into the jerkin covering her chest. Mare held his cup with both hands and slowly sipped from it. The differences between them were obvious even in the way they drank water. Momonga touched his throat as he saw the two of them. It felt like there was a thin layer of skin around his neck bones.
