"If you should ever visit the Royal Capital, I will give you anything you desire. I swear this on the name of Gazef Stronoff." Gazef let go of Ainz's hand, making to kneel, but Ainz extended his hand to stop him. "...There is no need to go that far... Very well, I shall protect the villagers. I swear that on the name of Ainz Ooal Gown." After hearing Ainz swear on his name, Gazef breathed a sigh of relief. "Thank you very much, Gown-dono. Now I have nothing more to worry about. All I need to do now is charge boldly ahead." "...Before that, please take this with you." Ainz took out an item and handed it to the smiling Gazef. It was a small, strangely carved statuette. There did not seem to be anything special about it. However- "If it is a gift from your good self, I will gladly accept it. Then, Gown-dono. Time grows short, but I must now leave." "...Will you not you wait until nightfall before setting out?" "The opposition should have spells like [Darkvision] and the like, so night fighting is not to our advantage, but I cannot imagine they will be hampered by it. Also... we also need to let you see how we stand or fall." "I see. As expected of the Kingdom's Warrior-Captain, your keen insight is truly worthy of praise. Then, I wish you all the best, Warrior-Captain-dono." "And I wish you a safe journey home, Gown-dono."
