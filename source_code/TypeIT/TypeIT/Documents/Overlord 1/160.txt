"Forgive me for wasting your valuable time MoDark Warriorsama. Then you lot will wait here for orders and explain to the others that I am on the move." "Understood Demiurgesama." "Well it seems your subordinates approve as well. Then Demiurge let us be off." Momonga walked past the bowing Demiurge who raised his head and followed his master.    "Why was Mo... cough why was Dark Warriorsama dressed like that" "I don't know but there should be some reason for it." The remaining Evil Lords muttered to each other in confusion. After all they had not seen through Momonga's disguise because he teleported here. Momonga had no idea of knowing this but the denizens of the Great Tomb of Nazarick or rather all of Ainz Ooal Gown's servants radiated a certain aura that the servants could sense in order to determine whether a stranger was friend or foe. Within the guild the aura of the 41 Supreme Beings that ruled Nazarick  now reduced to Momonga alone  was enough to tell them that the one before them was their absolute ruler. They could sense his mighty presence from a distance and they could not have mistaken Momonga for anyone else even through his full plate armor. They would have seen through Momonga's disguise immediately regardless of how he arrived. It was easy to differentiate his aura from the others in Nazarick. The doors to the first floor swung wide and someone climbed the stairs. Judging by the aura that came from the stairs the newcomer was a Guardian.
