This was because the recruitment standards for the Sunlight Scripture were very strict. Entry required the ability to cast 3rd-tier divine magic, which was also the highest tier of magic that ordinary magic casters could reach. In addition, prospective recruits had to be in excellent physical condition, and they had to possess a strong will and deep faith. In other words, they were the elite among other elite combatants.. The man quietly sighed as he watched his men disperse. Once they scattered to take their positions, it would be very hard to be sure of their movements. However, he was not worried about their skilful encirclement of the village. The Sunlight Scripture's commander, Nigun Grid Luin, only felt the peace of mind that came with knowing that success was at hand. The Sunlight Scripture was not used to long-term clandestine operations in the field. As a result, they had missed four chances to finish the mission in the past. They were exceedingly careful every time they closed in on Gazef and his men of the Kingdom, in order to avoid being spotted. If they missed this chance as well, these days of tracking and pursuing would drag on and on. "Next time... I'd like to ask the other teams for help, and leave some of the work to them." Someone answered Nigun's gripes. "That's right, we've always been specialized in extermination, after all." The speaker was one of the men who had stayed behind to protect Nigun. "I mean, this is a strange mission. Usually, we would have backup from the Windflower Scripture for something as important as this." "Indeed, I don't know why they only deployed us this time round. Still, this will be good experience for us. We can take this as training in infiltrating enemy territory. Hm, for all we know, that was what the people on top intended."
