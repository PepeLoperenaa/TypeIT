This mask was known as the Mask of the Jealous or the Jealous Mask. Once when he wore this mask he was flooded by messages. "Has the company gone mad" "We've been waiting for this." "Nobody in our guild has it can I PK him" "I'm done with being a human being" and other such things in a certain large message board. Then he took out a pair of gloves. Their rough exterior betrayed the fact that they were crudely made and had no special properties. These gloves were called Jarngreipr and they were an armor item made by one of Ainz Ooal Gown's members for fun. Its only ability was to increase the wearer's strength. He used these items to hide his skeletal appearance. Naturally there was a reason for this emergency camouflage. It was because Ainz realised he had made a fatal mistake. Ainz was used to YGGDRASIL and looking like a skeleton did not frighten him. However to the people of this world Ainz's appearance was synonymous with terror. Both the sisters who had nearly lost their lives and the fullyarmored knights were afraid of him. For the time being he would use magic items to change his appearance from a "dreadful monster" to "evil magic caster". That ought to reduce how frightening he appeared. Then he thought about the Staff. In the end he decided to keep it with him. Besides it was not a problem for him. "Rather than beg your god for aid you should not have massacred these people in the first place." With that line only an atheist could come up with Ainz looked away from the corpse whose fingers were folded into a gesture of prayer and cast a spell. "Fly." Ainz floated lightly into the sky Albedo soon followed him shortly afterwards.
