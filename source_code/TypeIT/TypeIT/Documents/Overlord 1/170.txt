"Our early-warning net has already been constructed. We will know of the intrusion of any intelligent beings within five kilometers, and we will be able to observe them without their knowledge." "Well done. However... this net is manned by the underlings, right?" Demiurge replied in the positive, and Momonga suggested it might be good to erect another security net, just in case. "...I have a plan for the security net. Put it into motion." "Understood. I will discuss this with Albedo and then combine her suggestions with your orders. Also, Dark Warrior-sama-" "-It's fine, Demiurge. You can call me Momonga." "Understood... may I ask about what you plan to do next, Momonga-sama?" "Since Mare has carried out his task splendidly, I intend to check in on him. I also plan to give him a suitable reward in person..." A smile appeared on Demiurge's face. It was a gentle look that seemed completely out of place on a devil's face. "I believe your thanks will be the finest reward he can receive, Momongasama... my deepest apologies, I suddenly remembered something I have to do. As for Mare..." "It's fine. Go, Demiurge." "Thank you very much, Momonga-sama." As Demiurge spread his wings to fly off, Momonga aimed for a point on the ground and landed, donning his helmet along the way. The Dark Elf near Momonga's destination seemed to notice his descent and looked up, surprise written all over his face as he saw Momonga.
