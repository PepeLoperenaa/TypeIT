"Th-thank you very much..." Momonga felt uncomfortable as he watched the two of them bow to him. He felt particularly ill at ease as he saw them look at him with their shining eyes. In order to camouflage the embarrassment he felt at being looked at that way, Momonga coughed. "Hm, that's right. Aura, I think you said something about being bored because there were no intruders?" "-Ah, no, that, about that..." After seeing Aura's fearful reaction, Momonga felt bad about asking his question. "I do not intend to reproach you for your answer, so feel free to speak your mind." "...Yes, a little. There's nobody around here who can spar with me for more than five minutes." Aura touched her index fingers together before looking up hopefully to Momonga. As a Guardian, Aura was level 100. There were precious few opponents in this dungeon which could rival her. There were nine such NPCs, including Aura and Mare, as well as one other. "What if Mare was your opponent?" Mare's body trembled as he shrank away. He shook his head with moist eyes, and he looked very afraid. Aura sighed as she saw the way he looked. As Aura sighed, a sweet scent filled the surrounding air. Unlike the fragrance Albedo radiated, this scent seemed somewhat persistent. As he remembered Aura's ability, Momonga took a step away from the scent. "Ah, sorry, Momonga-sama!"
