"...It's because it was a guild built by everyone, so it's my job as guildmaster to keep things going so that the members can come back at any time." "Yes. We had fun with the game because you were our guildmaster, Momongasan... I hope that when we meet again, it'll be in YGGDRASIL II." "I haven't heard anything about a second game... but like you said, I'd be glad if we could meet like that." "I'll look forward to it! I'm having trouble staying awake... I think I'll log off first. I'm glad I could meet you at the end. Goodnight." "..." Momonga wanted to say something, but he hesitated for a moment, and then he spoke: "I was very happy to meet you too. Goodnight." A smiley appeared near Herohero's head. Since characters in YGGDRASIL could not express emotions through their facial expressions, they used emoticons instead. Momonga worked his control interface, and produced a similar smiley. Herohero's last words were: "Let's meet up again somewhere." -And so, the last of the three guild members to come online tonight vanished. Silence descended once more - it was as though nobody had ever been here in the first place. Nothing was left behind. Momonga looked at the place where Herohero had been sitting, and he muttered the words he wanted to say. "Today's the last day of the game, I know you're tired, but we'll never have a chance like this again, why don't we stay together until the end-"
