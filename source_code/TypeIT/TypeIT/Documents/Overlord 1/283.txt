OVERLORD VOLUME 1 CHAPTER 5 RULER OF DEATH Part 1 There was no trace of the intense battle that had taken place earlier on the plains. The light of the setting sun covered up the blood staining the grass, and the stench of blood was blown away by the wind. There were two figures on the plains who had not originally been there. Nigun of the Slaine Theocracy's special operations unit - the Sunlight Scripture - looked at them with perturbation in his eyes. One of them was dressed like an arcane magic caster. He(?) wore an evillooking mask to hide his face, and a pair of iron gauntlets on his hands. He wore an expensive-looking black robe, suggesting he was a person of some status. The other one was dressed in a suit of jet-black full plate armor. It looked very impressive, and it was certainly some sort of masterwork magic item. One look at the exterior was enough to tell that it was a high-end magic item. The beleaguered Gazef and his men were gone without a trace. In their place were these two mysterious individuals. It seemed to be some kind of teleportation magic, but he had no idea what kind of spell had been used here. He had to be wary of the mysterious magic caster.
