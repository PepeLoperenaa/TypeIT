"Is, is that really alright?" To cut him short, Momonga produced the reward in question - a ring. "Mo-Momonga-sama... you've taken the wrong thing out!" "No I-" "-It can't be right! That's the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown, a treasure which only the Supreme Beings possess! I can't accept a reward like that." Momonga was shocked at how the unexpected reward was making Mare tremble. He was correct in that this ring was intended for the guild members. Only 100 of them had been made, so that meant that there were only 59 rings without owners - no, 58. As a result, they were quite precious, but the reason for this gift was not just as a reward, but the hope that it would be put to good use. In order to put Mare's rampant imagination at ease, Momonga sternly said, "Calm down, Mare." "I, I can't! How could I accept a valuable ring that only the Supreme Beings should possess-" "-Calm down, Mare. Teleportation is blocked in the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and that generates all kinds of inconveniences." After hearing this, Mare slowly regained his composure. "My hope is that during an enemy attack, the Guardians will command their respective Floors' forces. At the same time it would be quite sad if a Guardian was unable to move around freely due to the teleportation block. Therefore, I give this ring to you." Momonga raised the ring on his finger high. It glittered brilliantly in the moonlight.
