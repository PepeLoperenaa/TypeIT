Momonga, who pretended not to notice, opened his inventory and withdrew a backpack from it. Although it was called an Infinite Backpack, it could only hold up to 500 kilos of items. YGGDRASIL players commonly put their immediate-use items into this bag, because the items within the bag could be assigned to hotkeys in the game interface. After digging through several of these Backpacks, he found a small phial containing a red potion. It was a Minor Healing Potion. This potion could restore 50 HP, and beginners in YGGDRASIL frequently used it. However, Momonga as he was now had no need for this item at all. This was because this potion healed through positive energy. To an undead being like Momonga, this potion was like a damaging poison. However, not every member in the guild was undead, so Momonga kept some of these items just in case. "Drink it." "Momonga offered the red potion. The elder sister's face was pale with fright as she replied: "I, I'll drink it! Just, please, spare my little sister-" "Nee-chan!" He watched the little sister weeping as she tried to stop her elder sister, while the elder sister apologized to her little sister while taking the potion. Their reactions confused Momonga. After all, he had saved them in a tight spot, and had even offered them a potion. Why were they acting like this in front of him? What was going on here?
