Until now all the NPCs he had met were loyal to him. However in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick there were several NPCs on par with him. He had to make sure they were still loyal. However  Momonga glanced at the kneeling Sebas and the maids and then at Albedo beside him. Albedo was smiling. It was a beautiful smile but it seemed to be concealing something else behind it. As he wondered what that "something else" might be unease crept through Momonga. The NPCs were loyal to him but would they stay that way If this were in the real world subordinates would no longer be loyal to superiors who constantly screwed up. Would the NPCs be that way as well Or was it that once they were programmed to be loyal they would stay that way forever If their loyalty to him wavered how should he regain it Rewards There was vast wealth in the Treasury. Although it pained him to expend the treasures left behind by his former comrades they would probably understand if it was for the sake of Ainz Ooal Gown. The question would then be how large of a reward he should give. In addition was he superior to others by virtue of being higherranked. But what criteria could he use to quantify his superiority He was not clear about that yet. He had the feeling that as long as he kept this dungeon going he would eventually come to understand these things. Or did that mean "Power" He opened his left hand and gripped the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown that sailed into his grasp. "Overwhelming power"
