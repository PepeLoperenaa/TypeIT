They had attacked several villages and murdered defenseless innocent villagers all to lure Gazef into a trap. He could not allow himself to die at the hands of honorless dogs like this and he could not bear his powerlessness. "Gaaaaaaah Don't look down on me" He shouted with all the strength in his body. Blood dribbled out the side of his mouth as Gazef rose to his feet. A man who should have been powerless to stand now stood proudly the mighty force of his presence forcing back the angels that surrounded him. "Haaa Haaa" Just getting to his feet made it made him breathe hard. His mind was a blur and his body felt like it had turned to mud. But he could not lie down. If he lay down all would be lost. This little bit of pain he felt could not compare to the suffering of the dead villagers. "I am the WarriorCaptain of the ReEstize Kingdom I am a man who loves and defends his country How can I lose to bastards like you who stain my country with your footsteps" He was certain that great man would protect the villagers. Then what he should do was defeat as many of the enemy as he could  so the people would not meet the same fate as all the others. Protecting the future people of the Kingdom. That was all he wanted to do. "...You will die here because all you can do is babble that nonsense Gazef Stronoff." Gazef glared at the enemy commander as his cruel mockery reached his ears.
