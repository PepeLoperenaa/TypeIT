I have no idea what that means, Ainz thought. Asking them directly was a mistake. I should have tried a different approach. Besides, I was a lousy worker to begin with, and my job skills were pretty bad. It sounded like a large amount, but without knowing the value of money, he could not tell if it was an appropriate sum or not. He had to avoid accepting too high or too low a sum, lest he reveal his ignorance. No, he should have been relieved that they did not offer him "four heads of cattle" or something. Just as he was about to sink into depression, his mental state immediately settled down. Ainz silently praised his undead body, and then he realized one more thing. First, copper and silver pieces were the basic units of currency in this village. Second, there should be other forms of currency which were more or less valuable, but he was not confident that he could draw this information out of them. He needed to learn the monetary value of these copper pieces. Without that knowledge, things would be troublesome in the future. However, not knowing the value of money was quite suspicious, and he wanted to keep a low profile while he learned more about this world. That was why he was thinking as hard as he could to avoid making a bigger mistake. "These small coins are hard to carry in large amounts. I'd like something in a bigger denomination, if you can manage it." "Our sincerest apologies. If we could pay in gold pieces, we would. However... the fact is that our village does not use gold pieces..." Ainz fought back the urge to sigh in relief.
