Could it be that as one of the undead he no longer considered himself part of humanity No how could that be Momonga struggle to find an excuse to justify his thinking. He was not an agent of justice. He was level 100 but like he had told Mare this world's commoners might well be level 100 as well. Therefore he could not tread blindly into this unknown world. Although it looked like the knights were conducting a onesided slaughter of the villagers there might be other reasons at work here which he did not know about. Reasons like "illness "judgement" "setting an example" and others like them kept appearing in his mind. And if he stepped in and defeated the knights he might earn the ire of the country they belonged to. Momonga stretched out his bony hand and rubbed his skull as he thought. Could it be that after becoming an undead being who was immune to mindaffecting effects he had become inured to scenes like this Definitely not. He waved his hand again showing a scene from another part of the village. It seemed like two knights were trying to pull a violently struggling villager off another knight. The man was pulled away his arms were held and he was rendered motionless where he stood. Before Momonga's eyes the man was stabbed with a sword. The blade entered his body and exited from the other side of him. It should have been a fatal blow but the longsword did not stop. One two three strikes  the knight seemed to be taking out his anger on the villager as he hacked at the man's body. In the end the knight kicked away the villager who collapsed to the ground while spurting his blood into the air. The villager looked straight at Momonga. No this might have just been a coincidence. It was definitely a coincidence.
