Gazef was still smiling. What kind of look would Nigun have on his face when he met that inscrutable man called Ainz Ooal Gown Seeing that would probably be the best gift Gazef could receive before heading off to the afterlife. "...Angels kill Gazef Stronoff." Countless wings moved in response to that cold cruel order. Gazef steeled himself preparing to run forward when suddenly a voice came past him Looks like it's about time to switch. The scenery before Gazef changed and he was no longer on that bloodsoaked plain. Instead he was in the corner of what looked like a simple village hut. There were worriedlooking villagers all around him. "This this is..." "This is a warehouse that Ainzsama has protected with his magic." "So you're the chief... Gown Gowndono does not seem to be here." "No he was here just a moment ago but he seems to have vanished without a trace and in his place you appeared WarriorCaptainsama." I see so the voice in my head was... Gazef allowed himself to relax. He would have no part to play in what would come next. Gazef collapsed to the ground and the villagers hurriedly drew closer. The Six Scriptures. An enemy that even Gazef Stronoff the strongest warrior in the region could not hope to defeat. Yet he could not even begin to imagine that Ainz would lose.
