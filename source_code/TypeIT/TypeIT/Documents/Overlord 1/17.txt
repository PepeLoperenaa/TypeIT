The former was an Overlord  the highestranked of those magic casters who had become undead in order to learn the most potent spells. The latter was an Elder Black Ooze which boasted the most powerful corrosive ability of the slime families. One might encounter these monsters in the most difficult dungeons. Overlords could use powerful spells of the highest tiers of magic while Elder Black Oozes were dreaded for their ability to degrade weapons and armor. However they were not game monsters but players. In YGGDRASIL players could choose their character races from three broad groups humanoid demihuman and heteromorphic. Humanoids were the basic player type and comprised humans dwarves wood elves and the like. Demihumans tended to be ugly but possessed superior attributes to humanoids. Examples of demihumans were goblins beastmen ogres and so on. Finally heteromorphic races had monstrous abilities but despite their stats being generally higher than those of other races they also possessed various drawbacks. There were around 700 playable races in total including the advanced versions of these races. Naturally the Overlord and Elder Black Ooze were among the hightier heteromorphic races that were playable. The Overlord  who was speaking at the moment  did not move his mouth. That was because even the most advanced DMMORPGs of the time still could not overcome the technological hurdle of properly modelling the changes on a character's face in response to emotions and speech.
