"How. Disrespectful. As. Guardians. We. Are. To. Serve. Momongasama. Faithfully. So. He. May. Stay. That. Is. What. We. Were. Made. For." Demiurge turned to the interrupting Cocytus. "Of course I understand that Cocytus. But do you not wish to pledge your loyalty to Momongasama's heir" "Hmm... Of. Course. I. Would. Like. To. Swear. My. Allegiance. To. Momongasama's. Heir..." Cocytus began imagining himself running around with said heir on his shoulders. Then he began imagining himself teaching him swordsmanship drawing his blade to defend the Young Master and even hearing the fullgrown Young Master giving him orders. "...Oh. How. Wonderful. What. A Glorious. Sight... Uncle... Uncle..." Somewhat unable to bear it Demiurge averted his eyes from Cocytus who was fully into imagining himself as a cool old uncle faithfully serving Momonga's heir. "Well that aside I'm quite interested in knowing what our children can do for the strengthening of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. How about it Mare do you want to make a child" "Er eh" "Still you don't have a partner... if you discover any Humans Dark Elves Wood Elves or similar species would you kindly capture them for me" "Eh Ehhhhh" After thinking for a bit Mare nodded and said "If if it helps Momongasama... I'm willing to contribute. But how will I have children"
