not know Momongasama was coming Ah forget it I need to change and bathe" Albedo touched her clothing. Her clothes were dirty from her work. Her hair was tangled at the ends as were her wings. However such petty imperfections could not begin to diminish the appeal of a worldclass beauty like Albedo. It was insignificant like the loss of a point or two out of a hundred million. However to Albedo even the slightest blemish on her appearance was a failure. She could not show this filthy self of hers to the man she loved so dearly. "The nearest bath... the one at Shalltear's place... But then she might get suspicious... although I'll just have to bear with it. You lot go to my room and get my clothes Quickly" Just then one of the Evil Lords called out to Albedo who was pacing around. She was the Demon General of Jealousy. "...Albedosama though this might be rude would your present attire not be better" "...What do you mean" Albedo angrily retorted as she stopped in her tracks. She thought the other woman wanted her to see Momonga in her unkempt state. "...No I simply meant that a beautiful woman like yourself would be best served by showing the signs of your hard work. In the end you will still benefit will you not Albedosama" The other Evil Lords added their suggestions "By the time you could bathe and prepare yourself to meet Momongasama... Dark Warriorsama much time would have been wasted. It would be a shame to miss a good opportunity because of that." "I see" Albedo mused. They had a point.
