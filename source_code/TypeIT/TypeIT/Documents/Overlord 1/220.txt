What a pain. Should I try a different approach? Ainz decided to handle this in a way he did not like much. "...That said, this was not for free. I expect a reward commensurate with the number of villagers whom I saved." The villagers looked at each other. It would seem that they were worried about money. However, their doubtful looks faded away. This crass demand for money in exchange for salvation seemed to have allayed their suspicions somewhat. "With, with the village in its present state..." Ainz raised his hand to silence the other man before continuing. "We'll discuss that later. I rescued a pair of sisters before I came here. I will go bring them over now. Can you wait here for me?" He had to make sure those sisters did not talk and give away his true identity. Without waiting for them to reply, Ainz slowly headed off. At the same time, he thought about using magic to alter memories.
