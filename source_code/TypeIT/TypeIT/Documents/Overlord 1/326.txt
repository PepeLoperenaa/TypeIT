Albedo's smile shifted, going from graceful and elegant to lewd and wicked in an instant. it was a smile she would never show to Ainz. "Kufufufu, I've done it. No, I will definitely do it. I will be the one seated beside him. Shalltear will be nothing more than my footrest." Albedo clenched her fist, unable to resist the words boiling up in her heart. These were not words of a Guardian Overseer, but a woman. "Ah, my succubus blood is boiling..." Sebas silently watched Albedo as she acted up.    The Throne Room Sebas trailed behind Ainz as he entered the room, fashionably late. There were many people kneeling here, to show their loyalty. Nobody in this place moved a muscle, and it was so quiet that even the sound of their breathing could be heard. Apart from that, there was only the sound of Ainz and Sebas' footsteps, as well as the tapping of the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown on the ground. Ainz ascended the stairs and sat on the throne. Sebas remained at the foot of the throne, kneeling behind Albedo. Ainz silently surveyed the throne room from where he was seated.
