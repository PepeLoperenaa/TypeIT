Of course there was no response because Herohero had already returned to reality. "Haahh." Momonga's sigh came from the bottom of his heart. In the end it was better that it had remained unsaid. During their brief exchange he could already tell how tired Herohero was from the sound of his voice. Still despite his fatigue Herohero had still responded to the email he had sent and logged on for the last day of YGGDRASIL before it closed down. He should have been grateful enough for that. Asking him to stay on would not just have been a matter of being thickskinned but actively causing him trouble. Momonga stared at the seat Herohero had occupied until just now and then turned to look at the other 39 seats. Those were the places where his old comrades had once sat. After going a circle around the table Momonga returned his eyes to Herohero's place. "Let's meet up again somewhere... huh." Let's meet up again somewhere. See you again. He had heard these words several times before but they had never come true. Nobody had ever returned to YGGDRASIL. "When and where will we meet again" Momonga's shoulders shook violently and the words he could no longer hold back exploded forth "Are you kidding me" He pounded the table as he shouted.
