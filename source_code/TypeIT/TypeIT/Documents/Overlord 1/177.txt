As Momonga nodded to him, Mare rubbed the ring on his finger and left. "Speaking of which, why did you come here, Albedo?" "I heard Demiurge say you would be here, so I wished to greet you, Momongasama. However, I apologize for making you see me in this filthy state." Momonga looked at Albedo again as he heard the words "filthy". However, he did not feel that the words were fitting. Granted, there was dust on her clothes, but it did not lessen her beauty at all. "Certainly not, Albedo. Your radiance could never be diminished by something as insignificant as dirt. That said, I feel a little uncomfortable about making a beautiful maiden like yourself run around. However, since this is an emergency, I must ask you to continue working for Nazarick for the time being. I apologize for that." "I can endure any hardship as long as it's for your sake, Momonga-sama!" "I am grateful for your loyalty. Ah, yes... Albedo, I have something to give you." "...What might that something be?" As Albedo lowered her head and calmly replied, Momonga brought out a ring. Naturally, it was a Ring of Ainz of Ooal Gown. "You will need this item in your position as the Guardian Overseer." "...Thank you very much." Her reaction was so different from Mare's that Momonga was somewhat disappointed. However, he immediately realised that he was mistaken. The corner of Albedo's mouth was twitching and she was desperately trying not to let her expression change. Her wings were shuddering because she was trying her best not to spread them. The hand which took the ring had clenched up (when had she done that?) and then it opened up, trembling mightily. Even an idiot could see her excitement.
