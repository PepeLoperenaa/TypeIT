Holy Smite. The spell was cast and a pillar of light broke through the sky. With a loud whoosh a seemingly endless cascade of holy bluewhite radiance flooded down from the heavens submerging Ainz who simply raised one arm to shade his eyes. The 7th tier of magic  a height humanity could not hope to attain. This sacred power would annihilate all evil beings and even good entities would meet the same fate. The difference was only if they were reduced to sightless atoms or if there would actually be remains left behind. This was the awesome power of magic that exceeded the realm of humanity. No it would be strange if that were not the case. Yet  he was still there. Ainz Ooal Gown the monster was not blasted into glowing ash sprawled on the ground or pulverized into meat jelly but he was still standing nonchalantly and even laughing "Hahahahaha as expected of magic that has extra effect on those of evil alignment... so this is what taking damage feels like... pain is it I see I see Still even though I feel pain my mind is clear and my ability to act is not affected at all." The pillar of light vanished. It had not had any effect. "Wonderful I've concluded another experiment."
