Nigun was a powerful individual himself, a veteran of many battles who had grazed the edge of death countless times, who had taken many lives. He could feel the might radiating from the mysterious magic caster, an oppressive, potent pressure. It must have been worse for his men. What kind of being was he? What was the true identity of this magic caster? Who was the man beneath the mask? Once more, Ainz ignored Nigun's panic and spoke coldly: "That is why I did not lie to you and answered your question honestly. It is because there is no point in lying to those that are about to die." Ainz spread his arms and took another step forward. He looked like he was about to hug them, but his evil-looking fingers reminded them of a lunging monster. A thrill of cold ran from the bottoms of Nigun's feet to the top of his head. He had felt this countless times in his struggles along the edge of life and death. It was a sign of impending doom. "Have the angels charge him! Don't let him get close!" Nigun's voice broke slightly as he shouted his orders. It sounded more like a scream. It was not to raise his men's spirits. He was simply afraid of Ainz Ooal Gown. Two Archangel Flames flapped their wings in response to Nigun's command, launching an attack.
