"Then you are dismissed for today. Everyone take a break before beginning your duties. There are many things we do not know so do not push yourselves too hard." The Guardians nodded as one to show that they understood. "Finally I have a question for the Guardians. To begin with Shalltear  what kind of person am I to you" "An incarnation of beauty. You are the most beautiful person in the world. Even jewels pale in comparison to your snowwhite body." Shalltear did not pause to think about her answer before she gave it. From the lack of delay in her reply she must have been speaking from the heart. "Cocytus." "One. Who. Is. Mightier. Than. All. The. Guardians. And. Deserving. Of. The. Title. Of. The. Supreme. Overlord. Of. The. Great. Underground. Tomb. Of. Nazarick." "Aura." "A merciful leader with great foresight." "Mare." "A a very gentle person." "Demiurge." "A wise leader who makes decisions and acts on them quickly. Truly a man worthy of the title 'inscrutable.'." "Sebas." "The one responsible for assembling all the Supreme Beings. In addition the merciful leader who did not abandon us but stayed by our side until the very end."
