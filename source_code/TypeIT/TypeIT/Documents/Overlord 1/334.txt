In addition I wish to thank the readers of the WN version who gave me their thoughts and who were willing to read this. Without you readers who found the WN interesting it could not possibly have been novelized. I also want to thank my university friend Honey who helped me correct many contradictory and confusing parts of the book. I will need your help in the future as well. Finally I wish to thank the readers who purchased this book. I would be very proud if you find Overlord interesting. Incidentally I plan to correct and add more scenes and content to volume 2. It feels like I'm writing a new work so I can't help but cry and complain about the lack of time. I would like it if you could support volume 2 as well. Then the afterword will end here. I am extremely grateful to all of you. If you can continue to support me I would be overjoyed. See you again. July 2012 Maruyama Kugane
