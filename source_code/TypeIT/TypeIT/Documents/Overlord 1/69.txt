It was not fine at all. In contrast to Momonga's nervous request Albedo seemed to be overflowing with joy. She gave him a glittering smile. "But of course Momongasama. Please help yourself." Albedo straightened herself up presenting her ample twin peaks for Momonga's inspection. If he still had saliva he would have swallowed several times by now. Her breasts swelled up through her dress. And now he was going to touch them. On the other side of his abnormal tension and nervousness a quiet calm part of Momonga's brain was observing his own actions. He noted how foolish he was and wondered why he had thought of this and why he was still going to follow through anyway. He sneaked a peek at Albedo and found that her eyes were shining jiggling her bosom as though to say "hurry up and touch me". Not knowing whether it was because of excitement or embarrassment Momonga steadied his hands with sheer force of will steeled his resolve and reached out. The first thing Momonga felt was something hard under the dress followed by a soft yielding sensation. "Fuahh.. haaa..." As Albedo moaned wetly Momonga completed yet another experiment. If his brain was normal there were two possible explanations for his present situation. The first was that this was a new DMMORPG. That was to say the moment YGGDRASIL had shut down a new game "YGGDRASIL II" had immediately taken its place.
