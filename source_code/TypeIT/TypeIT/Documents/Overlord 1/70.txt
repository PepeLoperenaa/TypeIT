However in light of this experiment the probability of that being the case was vanishingly small. This was because R18 actions were strictly forbidden in these games. Who knew perhaps even R15 actions might be banned as well. Violators would be publicly listed on the game's official website and their accounts would be deleted or worse. Once the records of these R18 actions were publicly released they might be punished for damaging moral culture and thus violating the Social Order Maintenance Act. As such most people would consider these acts offlimits. If they were still in a game world the company should have made it impossible for players to do such things. If the GMs and the game companies were watching they would have prevented Momonga from performing lewd actions. However there was no sign of any resistance or opposition. In addition one of the fundamental rulings which pertained to DMMORPGS was that forcing a player to participate in a game without permission could be treated as a form of cyberkidnapping. As such forcing a player to test out a game in this manner was a prosecutable offense especially if there was no way to forcequit the game. It would not be unexpected for a company to receive fines or jail time for such things. If a situation arose where a player was not able to log out of the game up to a week's worth of game activity could be stored in a legallymandated record which would make it easy to prosecute the company for their violations of the law. Therefore if Momonga did not report to work for a week someone would have found it strange and come to his house to check on him. Then all the police would need to do was to access the records with a specialized console and the problem would be solved. Which company would risk arrest or worse to commit a corporate crime like this Of course they could try to muddy the waters by saying "this was a closed beta test for YGGDRASIL II" or "there were thirdparty programs used
