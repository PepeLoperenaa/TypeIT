"Momongasama wore this armor and concealed his identity because he did not wish to disturb the others at work." "When Momongasama approaches it is only natural for everyone to stop whatever they are doing and bow to him. However Momongasama did not wish to interrupt anyone. Thus he disguised himself as Dark Warriorsama so the others would not cease in their labors to pay him his due respect. Am I correct Momongasama" After hearing Albedo's question Momonga nodded repeatedly. "As as expected of you Albedo you understood my true intentions." "It is only natural as the Guardian Overseer. No even if I were not the Guardian Overseer I am confident that I could read your heart Momongasama." As Albedo smiled and bowed deeply there was a bizarre expression of Demiurge's face as he stood behind her. Although it weighed on his mind he could not object to the people assisting him. "So so that's why..." Mare said with a look of realization on his face. As he looked toward Mare Momonga saw a sight he could hardly believe was real. Albedo's eyes had suddenly gone wide open to the point where it seemed like her eyeballs might fall out. She was pointing at Mare in a strange way. Just as Momonga was thinking about this Albedo's face returned to its usual beautiful state so quickly that Momonga thought it had all been an illusion. "...What's wrong" "Ah no nothing... alright Mare sorry for disturbing you. Take a break and continue the camouflage work afterwards." "Yyes Then Momongasama I'll be on my way."
