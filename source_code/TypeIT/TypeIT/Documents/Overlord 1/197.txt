"It ran off... to think a shield would abandon the person it was supposed to protect. Then again, I did tell it to do so." Momonga reproached himself for his miscalculation. Although he could make quite a few more Death Knights, it was best to conserve limited-use abilities while he was not sure of the enemy and the situation. Still, Momonga was a back-line mage. Without a front-liner to run interference for him, he was effectively naked. Therefore, he would need to create another defender. This time, he would try making one without a corpse. Just as Momonga was thinking about that, a humanoid shape came through the still-open Gate. At the same time, the Gate's duration ended, and it slowly disappeared. A person clad in a suit of full-body black plate armor stood before Momonga. That suit of armor looked like a demon. It was covered in spikes and did not expose the slightest bit of flesh. Its clawed gauntlets grasped a black kite shield in one hand and a bardiche that radiated a sickly green glow in the other. A blood-red cape blew in the wind, while the doublet beneath was also the carmine of fresh blood. "The preparations took some time. I apologize for my late arrival," Albedo's melodic voice spoke from beneath the horned helmet. Albedo's levels were in the defense-focused Dark Knight class. As a result, among the three level 100 warriors of Nazarick - Sebas, Cocytus and Albedo - Albedo possessed the greatest defensive ability. In other words, she was the strongest shield in Nazarick. "No, it's fine. You came just in time."
