He tried his best to suppress the delighted expression on his face - although skeletons had no expressions - and continued: "Which was why I wanted to run some experiments with this Staff. I hope you can help me." "Yes! Understood! We'll go prepare right away! Then... could we see the power of the Staff?" "Mm, that's fine. Then, I shall show you a fraction of the power of this mighty Staff, which only I can wield." "Awesome" Aura exclaimed as she jumped up and down adorably. Mare was hard-pressed to hide his delight, as could be seen from the twitching tips of his ears. Ah, this is bad, I can't let my stern facade slip because of this. Momonga tried to regain his dignity as he reminded himself thusly. "...And there is one more thing, Aura. I have already ordered the other Guardians here. They will arrive within the hour." "Eh? Then, then we need to get ready for-" "No, there is no need. All you need to do is stay here and wait for them." "Is that so? Hm... all the Guardians - that means Shalltear's coming too?" "All the Guardians." "...Haa." Aura's long ears suddenly drooped.
