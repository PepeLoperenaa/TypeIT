Another was a feminine-looking monster with a crow's head, dressed in a tight-fitting bondage outfit. The final one wore full plate armor that was open at the chest, proudly revealing its abdominal muscles. If not for the black bat wings and the two horns protruding from its temples, it might have been mistaken for a beautiful young man. However, its eyes held a desire that knew no limit. They were the Evil Lords of Wrath, Jealousy(Lust) and Greed, respectively. All the Evil Lords turned their attention to Momonga, but they did not move, only watching with their unwavering gazes. The grim atmosphere weighed down on everyone present. They were all monsters around Level 80 or so, and they should have been assigned to sentry duty around the Infernal Shrine where Demiurge lived, near the Gate to the 8th Floor. Shalltear's undead minions should have been stationed in the upper floors to stand guard. So what were Demiurge's subordinates, his elite guards, doing in here? Behind them was one more figure. Momonga had not noticed him until now, but it had been watching Momonga from the beginning. Once he revealed himself, everything became clear. "Demiurge..." A surprised look appeared on the demon who had been addressed by name (Demiurge). That look seemed to be saying "why would his master be here", or "why would there be a mysterious monster here". Momonga decided to place his bet on a slim possibility, and advanced. If he stopped now, it would be a miracle if his true identity was not uncovered. In any event, his plan was to slowly move forward while staying near the wall, ignoring the monsters and walking past them. He was fully aware that their eyes were on him. However, Momonga suppressed his feelings of weakness with sheer willpower, held his chest high, and continued moving forward.
