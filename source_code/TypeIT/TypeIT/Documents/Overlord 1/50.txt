Momonga was startled but he still kept searching for the source of the voice. When he found the one who had spoken the words from just now he was speechless. The person who had answered him was the NPC raising her head  Albedo. Part 3 Carne Village. It was located on the border of the Kingdom at the Empire near the southern tip of the Azellerisia Mountain Range just outside a patch of woodland named the Great Forest of Tob. For a frontier village of the ReEstize Kingdom its population was unexceptional  120 souls distributed among 25 families. The village made its living from the resources of the forest and agriculture. Apart from doctors and herbalists who came to collect herbs the only visitors to the village were the yearly tax collectors. Time seemed to stand still for the few residents of this village. Village life was very busy even in the early hours of the morning. Villages did not possess the magical illumination of Continual Light which could be found in cities so the villagers would rise with the sun and work hard all day until the sun went down. The first thing Enri Emmot did after getting up extra early in the morning was to carry water from the nearby well. Hauling water was a woman's job and once she finished filling the big water tank in the house that chore was complete. By this time her mother would have prepared breakfast for their family of four. Breakfast was barley or wheat porridge as well as cooked vegetables. Sometimes they would have dried fruit as well. After breakfast she would tend the fields with her parents. Her 10 yearold sister would go into the forest to gather firewood or help with the field work.
