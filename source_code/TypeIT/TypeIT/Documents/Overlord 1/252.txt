This village was recently attacked by knights of the Empire, and if you gentlemen brought your weapons in, it might trigger unpleasant memories in the villagers. May I ask you to place your weapons in a corner of the village square, to put the people at ease?" "...It is as you say, Gown-dono. However, this sword was given to me by the King. I cannot set it down without his express permission." "-Ainz-sama, we will be fine." "Is that so, Chief-sama... then, please forgive my unreasonable request, Warrior-Captain-dono." "No, I see the logic in your thinking, Gown-dono. If this sword was not personally awarded to me by the King, I would gladly lay it aside. Then, could we sit down and discuss the details. Also, the sky is growing dark, and we would like to rest in this village for the night..." "I understand. Then, let us return to my home together-" In the middle of the chief's reply, one of the horsemen ran into the square. He was panting heavily, and had an urgent report. In a high-pitched voice, the horseman said: "Warrior-Captain! We've sighted a lot of people around the village! They've surrounded the village and they're closing in!" Part 3 "Everyone, take heed," a calm voice spoke into everyone's ears. "The prey has entered the cage." The speaker was a man.
