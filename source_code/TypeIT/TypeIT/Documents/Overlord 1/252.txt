"Before that I have a request you might not like to hear. This village was recently attacked by knights of the Empire and if you gentlemen brought your weapons in it might trigger unpleasant memories in the villagers. May I ask you to place your weapons in a corner of the village square to put the people at ease" "...It is as you say Gowndono. However this sword was given to me by the King. I cannot set it down without his express permission." "Ainzsama we will be fine." "Is that so Chiefsama... then please forgive my unreasonable request WarriorCaptaindono." "No I see the logic in your thinking Gowndono. If this sword was not personally awarded to me by the King I would gladly lay it aside. Then could we sit down and discuss the details. Also the sky is growing dark and we would like to rest in this village for the night..." "I understand. Then let us return to my home together" In the middle of the chief's reply one of the horsemen ran into the square. He was panting heavily and had an urgent report. In a highpitched voice the horseman said "WarriorCaptain We've sighted a lot of people around the village They've surrounded the village and they're closing in" Part 3 "Everyone take heed" a calm voice spoke into everyone's ears. "The prey has entered the cage." The speaker was a man.
