"...I may have said that I did not want a reward, but a magic caster uses many tools to achieve his aims, including fear and knowledge. These things are all tools for generating profit, but like I said earlier, I was focused on spell research, so my knowledge of local matters is somewhat lacking. Therefore, I would like to learn about the surroundings from the two of you. In addition, I hope you will not tell anyone about this sale of information. I will accept that in lieu of a reward." Nobody would be so nice as to say "I don't want anything". One could say that nothing was more expensive than being free of charge. Someone who saved another's life was entitled to a reward for their hard work. Yet, if the savior said they did not want a reward, anyone would find that strange. Then, the next best thing was to make the other side feel that they had paid in some way, even if it was in an intangible form. In other words, the best solution to the present situation was to allay their suspicions by having them trade information to Ainz. That would put them at ease. The chief and his wife nodded, steadfast looks on their faces. "I understand. We will not let anyone know about this." Ainz secretly clenched his fist in approval. It would seem the skills he had picked up through working could still be put to use here. "Excellent. I do not wish to bind you with magic. I shall trust your good nature." Ainz extended an armored hand. The chief stared blankly at it for a moment before taking the situation in, and he grasped Ainz's hand. After that, Ainz breathed a sigh of relief. It would seem shaking hands was a known practice here. It would have been tremendously depressing if the chief had looked dumbfoundedly at him.
