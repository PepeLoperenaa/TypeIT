the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick has been caught up in some kind of unknown situation." The Guardians' faces were still stern and there was no trace of surprise on them. "Although I do not know what has caused this incident the Great Tomb of Nazarick has been transported from its place in the swamps to a vast plain. Did anyone foresee the occurrence of this strange event" Albedo looked back at the Guardians and after seeing the reply written on their face she said "Regretfully none of us have any idea of what is going on." "Then I have a question for the Floor Guardians. Have any of you discovered anything strange in your floors" After hearing this each Floor Guardian responded "There are no abnormalities in the 7th Floor." "Same with the 6th Floor." "Iit's as neechan says." "The. 5th. Floor. Is. The. Same." "Nothing strange has been sighted in the 1st to 3rd Floors." "Momongasama I shall investigate the 4th and 8th Floors right away." "Then I will leave that matter to Albedo. However you must be careful on the 8th Floor. If an emergency situation occurs there a situation may emerge that you cannot deal with." Albedo bowed her head deeply to indicate she understood and then Shalltear said "Then I shall handle matters on the surface."
