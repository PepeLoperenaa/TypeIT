Nigun called the angels back, ordering them to form a defensive perimeter on their side. His assiduous gaze studied their movements, and then the magic caster stepped forward: "Pleased to meet you, gentlemen of the Slaine Theocracy. I am Ainz Ooal Gown. I would be glad if you could call me Ainz." He was some distance away from them, but the wind carried his voice over clearly. Nigun did not respond, and thus the mysterious man called Ainz continued: "The person behind me is called Albedo. I would like to make a deal with you. Might I have a moment of your time?" Nigun tried to attach some meaning to the name Ainz Ooal Gown, but it was no use. It might be an alias. Perhaps trying to glean some information from him would be more productive. With that, Nigun raised his chin, indicating that Ainz should continue. "Wonderful. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. Then, I would like to start by making one thing clear to you gentlemen. That would be - there is no way you can defeat me." He could hear the absolute confidence in that statement. This was not a bluff or a boast. This was something that the man Ainz Ooal Gown believed from the bottom of his heart. Nigun furrowed his brows. In the Slaine Theocracy, nobody would dare speak in such a way to their betters.
