"Thank you. Then... how shall we dispose of these inferior lifeforms? If you do not wish to stain his hands with their blood, I will gladly eliminate them on your behalf, Momonga-sama." "...What exactly did Sebas tell you?" Albedo did not respond. "I see, you didn't pay attention... my intention is to save this village. Our enemies are the knights in armor, like that corpse over there." Momonga saw that Albedo nodded in understanding, and turned his eyes elsewhere. "Then..." The two girls shrank under Momonga's unyielding gaze, and tried their best to make themselves as small as possible. Perhaps it was because of the Death Knight, or because they heard its roar, or because they had heard Albedo's words, which made them tremble uncontrollably. Perhaps it was all of them. Momonga felt that he should show his intention to help and reached his hand out to the elder sister, but the two girls seemed to have gotten the wrong impression. The elder sister wet herself, followed by the younger sister. "..." The stench of ammonia filled the surrounding air. Fatigue washed over Momonga like a tide. He had no idea what to do, and Albedo was no help, so Momonga decided to continue trying to express his good intentions. "...You seem to be hurt." As a working man, Momonga had long since trained up his ability to ignore things.
