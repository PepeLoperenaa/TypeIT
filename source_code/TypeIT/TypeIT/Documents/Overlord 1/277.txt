"Gahaah!" The taste of steel welled up in his throat, and Gazef spat a mouthful of fresh blood. The sticky ichor welled out of his mouth and stained his chin. Gazef's legs were shaky after that barrage of invisible blows, and now an angel was swinging its flaming sword at him. He could not avoid the blow, and it struck his armor. Fortunately, it deflected the sword, but the impact travelled through the breastplate and deep into his body. He swung wildly at the angel, but his poor balance meant that the angel easily evaded the attack. Gazef's sword trembled in his hands as he gasped for breath. The fatigue that filled his body seemed to be whispering into his ear, telling him to just lie down and rest. "The hunt has entered its final stages. Do not let the beast rest - order your angels to attack consecutively." Even though Gazef desperately wanted a moment to recover, the angels surrounding him obeyed their masters and mercilessly attacked him, one after the other. He somehow evaded the attack from behind, and parried a thrust from the side. He used the strong angles of his armor to deflect an angel's charge from above. Gazef wanted to counterattack his foes, but he was greatly outnumbered. As his strength diminished, he could only take out one opponent at a time, since he lacked the stamina to use martial arts. As his subordinates fell one by one, the enemy's attacks were concentrated on him. With no way to break through the enemy's encirclement, he felt death closing in on him.
