This was the first time Ainz had seen water boiled by a hand-started fire, rather than through the use of an electric kettle. He found it quite interesting. Back in his world, he had boiled water on a gas stove, so it was hardly as timeconsuming as this. This was also a good opportunity to gather some information on the technological level of this world. With that in mind, Ainz spoke to the chief again: "I do apologize, especially since you went to all this trouble to prepare water for me." "You are too kind. There is no need to apologize." The fact that Ainz lowered his head to them (however slightly) filled the village chief and his wife with dread. They could not imagine the Death Knight's summoner bowing his head to anyone. However, it was hardly strange to Ainz. It was always a good idea to have a friendly attitude when negotiating with someone else. Of course, he could simply have used [Charm Person] to make them talk, followed by high-tier memory alteration spells, much like he had done with the sisters. However, that was a last resort, because it took far too much MP. Ainz recalled the feeling of spending MP; it felt like a strange fatigue, like he had lost something. Just altering the tens of seconds of their memories - until he had put on his mask and his gauntlets - had taken a considerable amount of MP. "Then, let us cut to the chase and begin the negotiations." "Yes. But before that... thank you very much!" The chief bowed to Ainz, his head so low that it nearly touched the table. After that, his wife bowed as well. "Without your help, we would all be dead by now. You have our deepest thanks!"
