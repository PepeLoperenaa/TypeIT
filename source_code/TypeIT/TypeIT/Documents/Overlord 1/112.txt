What should he say All Momonga could do was grab his head and try to think. But in his heart he knew that this was most likely the case. Sebas' silence was a subtle hint that he was awaiting orders. Momonga glanced at the strap on his left wrist. In another 20 minutes the other Guardians would arrive. If that was the case there was only one order he could give. "Return in 20 minutes. When you come back to Nazarick head to the Colosseum. All the Guardians will be coming so when you arrive I hope you will tell them about what you saw. "Understood." "Then gather as much information as you can before you return." After hearing Sebas' acknowledgement Momonga terminated the 'Message' spell. Just as Momonga was about to sigh in relief that everything was over he remembered the expectant looks on the twins' faces. He had already told them he was going to verify the Staff's power so he had to let them see it. Momonga grasped the Staff and pondered which fraction of its might he should reveal. The numberless powers within the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown seemed to be begging Momonga to unleash them. Right now he needed a flashy spell. " Summon Primal Fire Elemental." In accordance with Momonga's will the Orb of Fire grasped within one of the Staff's snake mouths pulsed with puissance. Momonga could feel the movement of a mighty invisible power and thrust the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown forth. A vast ball of light bloomed from the tip of the Staff and a vortex of roaring flame spilled forth from that globe of radiance.
