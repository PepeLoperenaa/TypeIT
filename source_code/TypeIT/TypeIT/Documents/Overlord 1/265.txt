"I see, so that was why the Warrior-Captain left ... Then, then should we remain here?" "Of course not. They will come to kill you after they are done with the Warrior-Captain-dono. As long as you remain within their encirclement, you will have nowhere to run. However... while the foe is dealing with the Warrior-Captain-dono, you will have a chance to flee. You should take it." So that was why the Warrior-Captain rode out in force with his men. He planned to use himself as bait and lure the enemy away with a head-on attack. The chief red-facedly lowered his head as he heard about the WarriorCaptain's slim chances. The man was riding to his death just to give them a chance to flee. He cursed his inability to understand the man's sacrifice, and how he mistook Gazef's courage for selfishness and maligned him for it. "I can't believe I jumped to conclusions and wrongly blamed a good man... then, Ainz-sama, what should we do now?" "What do you mean by that?" "We live near the forest, but there's no guarantee that we won't be attacked by monsters. We were just lucky and thought that this place was safe, so we gave no thought to self-defense, and in the end, not only did we lose our friends and loved ones, but even became a burden..." Now it was not just the chief, but the villagers behind him who had looks of regret on their faces. "That could not be helped either. Your attackers were professional soldiers. If you had tried to resist, you might have all been dead before I got here." Ainz was trying to comfort the villagers, but none of them felt comforted at all. The fact was that no matter what pretty words he said, the loss of the villagers was an undeniable tragedy. All they could hope for was for time to heal their wounds.
