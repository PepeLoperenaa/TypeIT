Part 2 The burial ceremony was held in a nearby communal graveyard. It was surrounded by a brokendown fence and within were several circular stone slabs inscribed with people's names. The village chief recited the verses to ease the spirits of the dead and the words from his mouth appealed to a god that Ainz had never heard of in YGGDRASIL. It was a prayer that the spirits of the dead would find peace. It appeared that there were not enough hands to bury all the bodies at once so they chose to bury some of them first. To Ainz burying the dead on the day they died was too hasty but perhaps this was a normal practice for the faiths in this world. He spotted the sisters he saved among the other villagers  Enri Emmott and Nemu Emmott. Their parents' bodies were among those that would be buried today. As he watched the villagers from close by he idly stroked a 30 centimeter long wand under his robe. The wand was made of ivory and capped with gold. There were runes over the grip and it radiated an aura of holiness. It was a Wand of Resurrection. It was a magic item which could return the dead to life. Of course Ainz did not possess just one of these wands. He had enough to resurrect all the dead in the village with room to spare. According to the village chief this world's magic did not have the power to raise the dead. That being the case if he used the wand of resurrection he would create a miracle in this village. However after the prayer finished as the burial ceremony neared its end Ainz returned the wand to his inventory. He could have brought them back to life but he chose not to. This was not because he felt that the souls of the dead were the domain of the gods or some other religious reason. It was simply because he felt that there were no benefits in doing so.
