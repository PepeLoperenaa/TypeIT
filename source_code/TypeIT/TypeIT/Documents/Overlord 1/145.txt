must have something wrong in their head! Or could it be that you don't just look pure, but you don't have any fleshly desires at all, you big-mouthed gorilla?!" "...Lamprey!" The two of them glared at each other. The Guardians did not know if they would fight as a result of this, but the way they were looking at each other was very unsettling. "My appearance was created by the Supreme Beings, do you have a problem with it?" "Shouldn't I be saying that?" Shalltear slowly raised herself, and the two of them closed in on each other. Even so, their eyes remained locked. Eventually, the two of them came so close that they collided into each other. "Don't think you've won just because you're the Guardian Overseer and can stay next to Momonga-sama. If you really think that way, I'll laugh my ass off." "Hmph. That's correct. While you're stationed in a faraway place, I'll swoop in and achieve a complete victory." "...What do you mean by 'a complete victory'? Teach me, Guardian Overseersama." "As a slut, you should be fully aware of what that means." Throughout their trade of verbal barbs, neither of them had turned their gaze from each other. They simply looked into each other's eyes with a blank expression on their faces. With a pacha, Albedo unfurled her wings in a threat display. Black mist wreathed Shalltear as she responded in kind, unwilling to admit weakness.
