People were running in and out of their houses this early in the morning. They looked panicked. "No, that is not a festival." That steely voice came from Sebas, who was watching the display with a keen look in his eye as he stood beside Momonga. There was an undercurrent of disgust in Sebas' stern words. As Momonga enlarged the image, he too furrowed his nonexistent brows. Fully armored knights were swinging their longswords at the villagers, who were dressed in rough clothes. It was a massacre. A villager fell with every swing of a knight's sword. The villagers could not resist them, and could only run away. The knights pursued and killed the fleeing villagers. There were horses eating the grain in the field. Those horses must have belonged to the knights. "Cheh!" Momonga scoffed, intending to change the image. This village had no value to him. If he could extract more information from it, perhaps he might have a reason to save them. But as things stood, there was no reason to save this village. He should abandon them. Momonga was taken aback by how he could make such a heartless decision. A cruel slaughter was occurring before his eyes, but the only thing he could think of was the good of Nazarick. There was nothing like pity, anger or worry, basic human emotions anyone should have. It felt like he was watching a TV show about animals and insects, where the strong ate the weak.
