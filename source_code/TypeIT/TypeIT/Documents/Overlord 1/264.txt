Ainz quietly watched Gazef's back shrinking into the distance as he rode off. Although her master seemed to be thinking about something she did not inquire further. "...Haa...when I first saw the humans here I could not help but think of them as insects... but after speaking with them I have come to be fond of them like small animals." "Is that why you swore on your glorious name to protect them" "Perhaps... no I should say that it was in response to how he bravely rode to his death..." Ainz admired it. He admired Gazef's determination his strength of will that he did not have. "...Albedo order the servants to search out the ambushers around us and knock them out once they are found." "I will do so at once... Ainzsama the village chief and the others are here." As Ainz turned to look at Albedo he caught sight of the chief and two other villagers coming over. They reached Ainz's side panting heavily. Filled with tension and unease the chief spoke immediately as though breathing were a luxury he could not afford. "Ainzsama what should we do Why did the WarriorCaptain leave us behind and not protect us" The chief's words were filled with fear but there was an undercurrent of anger there as well. "...He is doing what he must do Chiefdono... The foe has their eye on the WarriorCaptaindono and if he stayed here the village would become a battlefield. The enemy will not let you flee either. He left this place for your sake."
