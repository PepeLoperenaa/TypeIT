The angels flew straight up to Ainz, and stabbed at him with their flaming swords. Albedo, who was standing behind him, should have blocked that attack. And so all of the Sunlight Scripture, who had been predicting that course of action, could not believe their eyes. It was not that anything happened. On the contrary- Nothing happened. Indeed, the man called Ainz Ooal Gown took no action. He simply allowed the angels to run him through. He did not dodge, block, cast a spell or have his follower intercept it. Nothing happened. Their shock became mockery. That act, pretending to be some mighty figure, was nothing but a bluff. It was not that Albedo did not wish to block it, but that Albedo could not respond in time to the high-speed attack of the Archangel Flame. Now that the truth was out, they did not seem like anything special at all. His men breathed sighs of relief. Nigun, who felt quite silly for being so afraid, turned to Albedo. "How unsightly. To think he would try to scare us with a bluff..." Suddenly, a question came to mind. Why was Ainz's corpse not falling? "...What are you doing? Call back the angels. He can't fall down with those swords stuck in him."
