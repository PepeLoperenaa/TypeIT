"With the exception of the 4th Floor Guardian Gargantua and the 8th Floor Guardian Victim, all the Floor Guardians are gathered before you. Thus do we offer up our utmost loyalty to the Master." Momonga could not speak as he looked at the six lowered heads before him. A strange pressure veiled the entire area, and perhaps only Momonga could bear the painful, crushing air. -He did not know how to proceed. He had never seen anything like this before in his life. In his confusion, Momonga accidentally activated a skill. A dreadful aura roiled out over the surroundings, and a halo of black radiance formed behind him. Momonga had no time to cancel the skill as he frantically racked his brains to recall a scene from movies or television which would tell him how to respond appropriately here. "Raise your heads." With a sha, everyone raised their heads. Their coordination was so immaculate that Momonga wondered if they had practiced that movement together. "Then... first, I thank all of you for coming here." "There is no need for thanks. We are all Momonga-sama's loyal subordinates. To us, Momonga-sama is our supreme overlord." None of the Guardians opposed her statement. As expected of the Guardian Overseer. Momonga looked on the Guardians with a stern face, and he felt a choking sensation in his nonexistent throat. It was the weight of being a leader bearing down on him. In addition, any orders he gave now would affect his relationship with them in the future. He could not help but hesitate as he contemplated the possibilities.
