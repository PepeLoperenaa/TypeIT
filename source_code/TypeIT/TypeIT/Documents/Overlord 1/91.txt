He might have resisted it with his base stats, or resisted it with his immunities from being an undead creature. Because he was not sure which hypothesis was correct, Momonga decided to conduct an experiment: "Can you try using other effects?" Aura tilted her head and made a strange noise of bafflement. Momonga was reminded of a puppy, and he reached out to stroke Aura's head. Her hair and scalp felt smooth as silk, and caressing her was very comfortable. Because Aura did not seem to mind, Momonga wanted to keep going on. However, Mare looked a little frightened as he stared at them from the side, so he paused. What was Mare thinking, anyway? After thinking for a short while, Momonga released his staff and ruffled Mare's hair with his other hand. The quality of Mare's hair felt better, but Momonga hardly paid it any heed as he rubbed their heads until he was satisfied. Then, he remembered what he was here to do: "Then I have something to ask of you. I plan to conduct certain experiments... I'll need your help for them." At first, the two of them did not know how to respond to that. However, when Momonga's hand left their heads, the two of them had embarrassed yet happy looks on their faces. Aura cheerfully replied, "Yes, I understand! Momonga-sama, leave it to me!" Momonga reached out a hand to quell Aura. "Before that-" Momonga gripped the floating staff in his hand.
