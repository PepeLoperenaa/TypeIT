Once he noticed this, he felt a clenching pain in his nonexistent stomach. What if he became weaker from this? Every time he thought about that, he tried desperately to put it out of mind. "And what was its effect?" "Ah, the effect just now... should have been fear." "Umu..." He did not feel afraid. In YGGDRASIL, one would not be affected by attacks from the guild or party to which one belonged. Although, there was a very real chance this rule no longer applies, so it would be best to verify that now. "Aura, I was just thinking that your skill should not have an effect on people from the same guild... the same group." "Eh?" Aura's eyes went wide, much like Mare's did from the side. Judging from their reactions, Momonga realised that they did not agree with him. "Am I mistaken?" "Yes... Could it be you mixed it up with the ability to freely change the range of one's skills?" So it seemed the rule disabling friendly fire was no longer in effect. Mare was not affected while being near Aura, but that might be because he had equipped an item which negated mind-affecting effects on himself. In contrast, the undead Momonga's divine-class items did not have any data which protected against mind-affecting effects. But in that case, why did Momonga not feel fear? There were two possibilities.
