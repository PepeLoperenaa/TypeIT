That man who loved nature was always particularly excited when the topic came up. Some might even call it an obsession. How excited would he be if he could see this world? How passionately would he declaim its glories in his baritone voice? Momonga suddenly realized that he missed his old friend very dearly. Hoping to hear him expounding his wide knowledge again, he looked to the side. There was nobody there. There could not be anybody there. The somewhat hurt Momonga heard the flapping of wings, and the transformed Demiurge appeared before him. This was Demiurge's half-demon form, with a pair of large black leathery wings growing from his back and the face of a frog. Certain heteromorphic creatures had multiple forms. In Nazarick, Sebas and Albedo had other forms as well. Although it was troublesome to train up levels in heteromorphic racial classes, they were very popular because they had different forms like final bosses in a game. In particular, people were fond of how these heteromorphic beings were weaker in their human and demihuman forms, but more powerful in their fully monstrous forms. Momonga turned away from Demiurge, who was partially transformed into a demon, and looked to the sparkling stars in the sky once more. He spoke softly, as though to his absent friends: "...To think one could see so far just by the light of the moon and the stars... it's hard to believe that this world is real. Blue Planet-san... this world is like a chest of jewels." "Perhaps it is. I believe the beauty of this world exists to adorn you, Mo- Dark Warrior-san," Demiurge said in a reverent voice.
