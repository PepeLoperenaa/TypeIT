As he watched the retreating Albedo Momonga let himself sigh in a way that suggested he was thoroughly exhausted. Once she left the Throne Room Momonga groaned painfully "...Oh what have I done It was supposed to be a silly joke... If I'd known I wouldn't have done it. I've... I've soiled the NPC Tabula Smaragdinasan created..." When he thought about it there was only one reason why Albedo would react like she had. It must have been when he was editing her backstory and changed that line to "She is in love with Momonga." That must have been why she acted that way. "...ah... shit" Momonga muttered to himself thinking about how Tabula Smaragdina had painstakingly created his masterpiece Albedo out of whole cloth and then someone else had splashed paint all over his work at will and now she had become like this. The knowledge that he had ruined someone else's hard work made him feel miserable. However the frowning Momonga  although it could not be seen because he was a skeleton  eventually rose from the Throne. Momonga told himself that he had to leave this at the back of his mind. After the important things were taken care of he could agonize over it later.
