"I see... so there were people out there." Gazef peeked out at the people surrounding the village from inside the darkened house. He could see three people within his field of vision. They were slowly advancing on the village while maintaining an even separation from each other. They were unarmed and were not wearing heavy armor. However that did not mean that they were pushovers. Many magic casters disliked such equipment and preferred lighter gear. This suggested that they were magic casters. However it was the winged monsters floating beside them which confirmed their vocations. Angels. Angels were monsters summoned from another world and many people  particularly the citizens of the Slaine Theocracy  believed them to be messengers of the gods. However the priests of the Kingdom ruled that these socalled angels were merely summoned monsters. While these religious disputes were part of the reason why the countries were set against each other Gazef felt that their status as divine messengers was secondary to their strength as monsters. To Gazef angels and demons their similarlyranked counterparts were stronger than many other monsters summoned using magic of a similar tier. Most of them had special abilities and some could even use magic. They were troublesome foes in his reckoning. Of course that depended on the individual angel. Not all of them were difficult to beat. However the angels this time round with their shining breastplates and flaming swords were of a type that was unknown to him.
