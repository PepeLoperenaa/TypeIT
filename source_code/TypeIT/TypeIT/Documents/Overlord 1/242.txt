It was not hard to tell which would be more threatening a magic caster that could take lives or a magic caster which could return them. In addition the chances of the villagers keeping the secret would be very low even if he ordered them not to talk about the resurrections. The power to conquer death was something that everyone craved. If things were different he might have used that power to recall people to life. However he did not have enough information on the local conditions so it would be unwise to do so now. "They should be content with the fact that the village was saved" Ainz muttered as he looked at the Death Knight that was standing behind him. The Death Knight was another mystery. In YGGDRASIL all summoned monsters would vanish after a certain time unless special methods were used in their summoning. He had not used any such methods to summon the Death Knight and its summoning time was long past but it remained here. Although he had many hypotheses for this phenomenon he still did not know enough to come to an answer. As Ainz was thinking about this a pair of figures turned up beside him. One was Albedo and the other was roughly humanoid but resembled a spider dressed in a ninja uniform. Its eight legs were tipped with sharp blades. "An Eight Edge Assassin Albedo this is..." Ainz looked around but it seemed like none of the villagers were paying attention here. Albedo was one thing but bringing a monster here would make them the center of attraction even if the burial was going on. Just then Ainz remembered that Eight Edge Assassins were monsters that could go invisible. "I brought him over because he wanted to pay his respects to you Ainzsama."
