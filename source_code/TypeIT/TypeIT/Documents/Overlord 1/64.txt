The seven gems set into the staff gleamed brightly, as though imploring their master to use their colossal might. "...Forget it, I'll take my time to think about that later." Momonga released the staff he held, and the wavering staff fell to the ground as though it were angry at him. In any case, as long as he acted the part of the leader, they would probably not raise their hands against him right away. Be it among animals or humans, enemies would probably not attack if their intended prey did not reveal any weaknesses. Momonga declared in a powerful voice: "Pleiades. Apart from the maid selected to accompany Sebas, the rest of you will head to the 9th Floor and repel any invaders from the 8th Floor." "Understood, Momonga-sama." The maids behind Sebas acknowledged his orders respectfully. "Begin immediately." "Understood, my master!" Once more the chorus of voices rang out. Sebas and the maids bowed once more to their lord who sat upon the throne, then stood and left simultaneously. The giant doors opened, and then closed again. Sebas and the maids vanished beyond the doors. It was good that they had not replied with a "No" or something similar. A great weight seemed to lift off Momonga's chest, and at the same time he looked at the person who had stayed by his side. That person was Albedo, who had stood by, awaiting orders.
