It was not good to have too many doubts but blind trust was not a wise move either. He would cross that bridge when he came to it. Momonga turned his mind to the present. Another reason for coming here was that if he found that he could not use magic he could discuss the situation with Aura and Mare. The twins thought he had come to test the power of the Staff so now that its power had been proven he could cover up any ineffectiveness of his own magic. It was a pretty good plan. Momonga could not help but congratulate himself. Had he ever been so cool and calculating in the past However there was nobody here who could answer Momonga's question. He cast aside the doubts in his mind and focused on using the magic of YGGDRASIL. There were over 6000 spells in the game from Tier 1 to Tier 10 as well as SuperTier magic. These spells were divided among various types and schools and Momonga could use 718 of them. A normal level 100 player would only be able to use 300 of them so Momonga was an exceptional case. Momonga had memorized almost all of these spells and he considered which one to use now. To begin with because the restriction on friendly fire had been lifted he needed to know how the effective radius of a spell would show itself. Therefore he decided against a singletarget spell but picked an areaeffect spell. Next considering his target was a strawman he should In YGGDRASIL he could cast a spell by tapping its respective icon. However there were no icons for him to touch. Therefore there had to be some other way.
