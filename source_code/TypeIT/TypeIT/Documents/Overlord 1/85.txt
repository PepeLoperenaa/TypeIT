"I'm positively overflowing with energy... although it's been a bit boring recently. It would be nice if we had an intruder or two." "I I would rather not have to meet intruders... they they're scary..." After hearing Mare's words Aura's expression changed "...Haa. Momongasama please excuse me for a while. Mare come with me." "Ooww... Neechan that hurts..." After seeing Momonga nod slightly Aura pinched Mare by the tip of one of his ears and dragged him away from Momonga. Then she began whispering into Mare's ear. Even from a distance one could tell that she was scolding him. "...Intruders huh. Well much like Mare I don't want to meet them either..." At least I'd rather meet them after having the chance to make all the preparations I need Momonga thought as he watched the twin Guardians from afar. After he snapped back to reality Momonga realised that Mare was on his knees in front of Aura who was hurling a torrent of abuse at him. Momonga smiled as the scene reminded him of the brother and sister who were his friends "Good grief Mare was clearly not made by Peroroncinosan. Or is this because Bukubukuchagamasan believed that 'Little brothers should listen to their big sisters'... Though come to think about it Aura and Mare should have died once. How should I address that" The invasion of 1500 people had made it down to the 8th floor. Which was to say Aura and Mare should have died then. Did they remember anything about it What meaning did the concept of "death" have for those two anyway
