"Thank you Sebas. Although I apologize for making you accompany me for so long." "What are you saying Staying by your side and obeying your orders is the reason for a butler's existence Momongasama. There is no need to thank or apologize to me... although it is true that this process took quite some time. Momongasama would you like to take a break" "No there is no need for that. Undead like myself are not affected by negative statuses like fatigue. If you're tired you may go and rest." "Thank you for your kindness but it would be unthinkable for a butler to rest while his master worked. With the aid of magic items I am not affected by fatigue either. Please allow me to stay by your side until the end Momongasama." Momonga realised one thing from his conversations with the NPCs namely they casually used game terms in their speech. For instance skills job classes items levels negative statuses and so on. If he could use game terms with them in an unironic way it might be easier to give them orders. After agreeing to Sebas' request he continued studying the ways to control the mirror. Finally he discovered a method to adjust the height of his viewpoint. Momonga smiled in satisfaction and began looking for a populated area. Finally an image of something like a village appeared on the mirror. It was located roughly ten kilometers south of Nazarick. There was a forest nearby and wheat fields surrounded the city. It appeared to be a rustic farming village. By the looks of things the village itself was not very developed. As Momonga zoomed in on the village he felt that something was amiss. "...Are they holding a festival"
