"Ngk! Puh! Principality of Observation! Get him!" In response to Nigun's orders, the angel that had been standing by up till now suddenly spread its wings and flapped, propelling itself forward. The Principality of Observation was an angel in full body armor. It held a mace in one hand and a round shield in the other. A garment that looked like a long skirt covered its legs. The Principality of Observation was stronger than the Archangel Flames, but it had not been deployed into battle until now because of its special skill. In accordance with its name, the Principality of Observation had the ability to raise the defense of all its allies. However, this ability lost its effect once the angel moved, so the wise decision would be to order the Principality of Observation to hold its ground. The fact that Nigun had ordered it to attack was a sign that he was grasping at straws. He had to clutch at anything which might turn out to be a lifeline, even if it ended up being chaff. "Fall back, Albedo." As ordered, the angel drew up in front of Ainz, and raised its shining mace. Ainz nonchalantly reached out his gauntleted left hand to meet the attack. While it would not have been surprising for that strike to shatter bone, Ainz's hand was fine. He casually took the subsequent hits as they came. "Good grief... I guess it's my turn now. [Hell Flame]." A small, wobbling mote of flame emerged from one of the fingers of Ainz's right hand. It looked so feeble that anyone could blow it out if they wanted. It touched the body of the Principality of Observation, and looked terribly laughable against the glittering body of the angel.
