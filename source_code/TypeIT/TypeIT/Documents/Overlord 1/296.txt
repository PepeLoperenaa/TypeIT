Not only could he slaughter all their summoned angels in one move, their spells were also incapable of harming him. Nigun felt like he was trapped in a nightmare. "Hyaaaaah-!" One of the men screamed wildly as he saw that his spells were ineffective. In desperation, he pulled out a sling and loaded it with a bullet. Although Nigun doubted the effectiveness of such a projectile when even an angel's sword was useless, he did not stop the man. The bullet that could easily shatter bone sped toward Ainz. It was followed by a sound. That sound was like an explosion. An instant. It had happened in an instant. Since they were in battle, they could not take their eyes off their target. However, Albedo - who should have been behind - had moved in a mysterious way in front of Ainz to defend him. The source of the apparent explosion was because she had violently kicked off the ground to get to where she was. With a speed that the eye could not even see, Albedo swung her bardiche, tracing a beautiful curve of the weapon's sickly green light in the air. After that, the man with the sling slowly collapsed to the ground.
