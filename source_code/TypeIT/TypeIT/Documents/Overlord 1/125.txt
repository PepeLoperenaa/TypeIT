"Shut up shorty It's not like you have anything of your own At least I... no I've got a lot more to show off" Aura simply grinned in the face of Shalltear's desperate counterattack. A shocked Shalltear stumbled back and reflexively covered up her chest. It was a sorry sight. "...I'm only 76 and I've got lots more time to grow unlike an undead with no future like you. Ah how sad  you will never grow again" Shalltear moaned in frustration and took another step back. There was a desperate harried look on her face which only made Aura smile in a frightening manner. "To think you're actually happy with that bust of yours  Hmph" Momonga imagined he could hear Shalltear snapping. "You shitty brat It's too late to regret your words now" Roiling black mist boiled off Shalltear's hands. Aura readied her whip in anticipation. Momonga and Mare watching from the side were at a loss for words. The scene before Momonga's eyes was vaguely familiar and he wondered if he should stop them. Peroroncinosan who designed Shalltear and Bukubukuchagamasan who designed Aura and Mare were younger brother and elder sister and at times they would argue in a friendly manner like what was happening now. Momonga recalled the forms of his former comrades as he stood behind the quarrelling pair. "What. A. Ruckus." The inhuman voice came just as Momonga was reminiscing about the past. The strange monotonous voice finally silenced the two of them.
