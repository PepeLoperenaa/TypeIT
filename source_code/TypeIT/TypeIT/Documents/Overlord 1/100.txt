"I know that, but..." "Just leave this matter aside for..." Gazef's voice cut off halfway, as his eyes looked intently forward. Thick, black smoke rose up from behind the small hill ahead of them, and it was not just one or two plumes. Everyone present knew what that meant. Gazef couldn't help but click his tongue, and he squeezed his legs around his horse's flanks. The scene which the rapidly galloping Gazef and company saw did not deviate from their expectations. Before them spread an expanse of blackened ground, the scorched remains of a village. The corpses of several of the burned houses remained standing, like tombstones. Gazef gave an order in with a voice of steel: "Everyone, we're moving. Quickly now!"    The village had been put to the torch, and only the burned skeletons of the destroyed homes gave any clue as to what it had been like before. The smell of blood blended with the stench of burning as one walked between them. Gazef's face was calm, with no hint of any emotions on it. However, no expression could convey his feelings more clearly than this. The same applied to Vice-Captain who walked by Gazef's side. Over a hundred villagers had lived here. Six had survived. Everyone else had been mercilessly slain, whether they were women, children, or infants. "Vice-Captain, have some of our people return the survivors to E-Rantel."
