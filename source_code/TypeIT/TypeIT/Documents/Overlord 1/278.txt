His concentration faltered and he nearly fell to one knee. He desperately tried to refocus so he could fight. The invisible impacts came again striking the tottering Gazef. The world before him shook mightily. Not good Gazef used all his strength to try and maintain his balance. However something seemed wrong with his body and the strength that should have held him up was nowhere to be found. The itch of touching the grass spread through his body and Gazef realised that he had fallen. He struggled to rise again but his body betrayed him. The angels' swords meant death for him. "Now finish him off but do not send in one angel. Use them all to ensure he is dead." Yes he was dead. His welltrained hands were shaking uncontrollably and he could not pick up his longsword. Even so he could not give up. His gritted teeth made creaking sounds. Gazef was not afraid of death. He had taken many lives in the past so he was prepared to meet his end on the battlefield. Like he had told Ainz he was hated by people. That hatred became a sword that would one day pierce his body. But he could not accept an end like this.
