"Ah, my deepest apologies, Momonga-sama!" Albedo's head was as low as it could go, and her face was frozen in fear. The Guardians and Sebas stiffened up as well. Perhaps they thought that scolding was directed at them as well. A twinge of remorse struck Momonga as he observed the quick change in the Guardians' attitude, but he continued speaking to Mare: "Can you conceal the walls by heaping dirt onto them?" "Yes, yes I can, if you allow it, Momonga-sama ... However..." "Yes, an observer from a distance would think the ground was bulging up unnaturally. Sebas, are there any nearby hills or the like?" "There are none. Regretfully, we are surrounded by flatlands. However, since there are nights here, we should be able to perform some sort of eyedeceiving camouflage while the sun is down." "Is that so... if all we intend to do is hide the walls, Mare's idea will be enough. Then, what if we piled up the dirt from the nearby land to make dummy hills as camouflage?" "Then we would blend in." "Very well. I shall assign Aura and Mare to carry out this task together. While doing so, you may draw the necessary supplies from each Floor. Since we cannot camouflage the view from the air, we shall use illusions after finishing the earthworks, so nobody will be able to detect Nazarick from the outside." "Y-yes. U-understood." That was all he could think of at the moment. There were probably a lot of holes left in the plan, but that could be dealt with slowly, later on. After all, it had only been a few hours since all this had happened.
