However, she was holding her little sister's hand. It gave her the energy to run away. The truth was that the powerful desire to save her sister had kept Enri going until now. As she ran, she glanced behind again. The distance between herself and her pursuer had not changed. Even in armor, the man's speed had not decreased. This was the difference between a trained warrior and a village girl. Sweat ran down Enri's back as her body went cold. If this kept up... she would not be able to escape with her sister. -Let her go. Those words echoed through her head. -Perhaps you could escape by yourself. -Do you want to die here? -It might be safer if you split up. "Shut up, shut up, shut up!" Enri shouted at herself for those thoughts through her clenched teeth. She was the worst sister imaginable. Why was her little sister holding her tears back? It was because she believed in her big sister. She believed her big sister would save her. As she gripped the hand of her little sister - that hand which gave her the strength to flee and fight on - Enri steeled herself and hardened her resolve.
