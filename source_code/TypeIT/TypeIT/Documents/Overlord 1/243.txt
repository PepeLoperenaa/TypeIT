"Oh, how refreshed my soul is whenever I see Ainz-sa-" "-Enough of that. Are you part of the support troops?" "Yes. There are 400 vassals beside myself who stand ready to assault the village at any time." Assault? How had it ended up like this? As Ainz pondered that problem, he began muttering to himself - Sebas had no talent for passing messages. "...There's no need for an assault, the problem's already been taken care of. Who's your commander?" "That would be Aura-sama and Mare-sama. Demiurge-sama and Shalltearsama remain in Nazarick on alert, while Cocytus-sama is supervising Nazarick's perimeter security." "I see... well, too many cooks spoil the broth. Everyone but Aura and Mare are to fall back. How many of you Eight Edge Assassins are there?" "There are 15 of us in total." "Then you can stay with Aura and Mare." After watching the Eight Edge Assassin nod in acknowledgement, Ainz turned his eyes back to the burial. They were about to fill in the graves, and the two girls were crying non-stop. In order not to interrupt the burial, Ainz strolled leisurely toward one of the roads leading to the village. Behind him were Albedo and the Death Knight. Though his information-gathering had been interrupted by the funeral. Ainz had still managed to learn much about the region and the ways of this world. By the time he left the village chief's home, the sun was going down. It would seem his little hero act - to pay forward the kindness his old friend showed him - had taken more time than expected.
