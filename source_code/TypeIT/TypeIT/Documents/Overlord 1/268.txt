"Please let us protect our country, our people, and our friends!" There was nothing left to say. Gazef returned their shouts with a thunderous cry: "Then, forward! Tear their guts out!" "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!" Gazef's men spurred their horses forward to follow their leader. The galloping horses shot across the plains like an arrow loosed from a bow. Still mounted, Gazef drew his bow and nocked an arrow to the string. Though his horse shook and shuddered beneath him, Gazef calmly drew the string back. The loosed arrow struck its target unerringly, piercing the head of the frontmost magic caster... or at least, that was what he thought would happen. "Cheh! It was useless after all. Maybe if I had a magic arrow, but... ah, I don't have what I don't have. Griping about it here is pointless." The arrow bounced off like it had struck a sturdy helmet. That supernatural hardness must have been the work of magic. Just as Gazef had said, in order to shoot through magic that protected against ranged attacks, he would need a magic weapon of his own. Since Gazef did not have a weapon like that, he stopped shooting and put away his bow. The magic casters began their counterattack, and cast their spells. Gazef focused his energies, and took a stance in order to resist their magic. Just then, the horse between his legs whinnied loudly and reared up, its front legs kicking the air. "Go! Go! Go!"
