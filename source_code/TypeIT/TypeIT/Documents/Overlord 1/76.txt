OVERLORD VOLUME 1 CHAPTER 2 FLOOR GUARDIANS Part 1 "To me Demons of the Lemegeton" The golems made of rare metals heeded Momonga's command and moved before him with an agility that belied their heavy bodies then took the ready stance they had assumed earlier. Now that Momonga had decided to go with his theory that virtual reality had become reality his first concern was to guarantee his own safety. Although the NPCs he had met so far had readily obeyed him there was no guarantee that the others he met would react in the same way. Also even if they were all friendly he did not know when danger would next appear. Momonga's life and death hinged on whether or not he could use such things as Nazarick's facilities the golems his items his magic and so on. "Well that's one problem solved" Momonga muttered to himself in relief as he looked at the golems. He then ordered them only to listen to him. That way even in the worstcase scenario  if one or more NPCs revolted  he would have an ace in the hole. Momonga satisfied with the mightylooking golems looked down at his bony hands. He wore nine rings on his ten fingers and only his left ring finger was bare. In YGGDRASIL most of the time one could only wear two rings one on each hand. However Momonga had used permanent cash items which were very expensive to let him wear a full ten rings one on each finger and use all their powers at once.
