"If you throw down your arms, I can guarantee your lives. Of course, if you would rather fight-" One sword was cast to the ground. It was shortly followed by the other swords being thrown down until there were four blades on the ground. Nobody spoke during this time. "...You seem quite tired. Although, don't you think your heads are held a bit too high before the master of the Death Knight?" The knights immediately prostrated themselves before him without a single sound. They did not look like vassals before their lord so much as convicts awaiting execution. "...I will permit you to leave with your lives. In exchange, tell your master - your owner - this." Ainz used the effects of the [Fly] spell to move near one of the knights, and then he removed his helmet with the hand that was not holding the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. He noted the man's exhausted eyes, and their gazes met through the mask. "Do not make trouble around here. If you make a disturbance here, I will slay you with the rest of your country." The trembling knight nodded as hard as he could. His frantic gesture looked quite comical. "Get lost. And make sure to relay this to your master." He jerked his chin, and the knights fled like rabbits. "...Ah, this act is tiring," Momonga quietly grumbled as he watched the knights run away.
