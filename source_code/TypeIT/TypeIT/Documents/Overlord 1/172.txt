"Which is why, Mare, I wanted to let you know how satisfied I am that you have carried out your task. In addition, I want to tell you how relieved I am that you were the one handling this matter." One of the ironclad rules of society that Momonga believed in was that a good boss should compliment the good work of his subordinates. The Guardians thought highly of him; conversely, in order to have them continue to be loyal to him, Momonga had to act in a way that was worthy of their praise. Allowing these NPCs that his guild members had made together to feel disappointment or betrayal because of his actions would shatter his golden record as a guild master. It would be like a mark of failure branded on Momonga. Because of that, Momonga had to be careful to maintain the air of authority befitting a ruler when he spoke to the NPCs. "...You understand what I'm thinking, don't you, Mare?" "Yes! Momonga-sama!" Mare might have been dressed like a girl, but the fact that he was a boy was evident from his panicked face. "Very good. Then, for your hard work, I shall give you a reward." "How, how could I accept such a thing? I was simply doing my duty!" "...You deserve a reward for your good performance. It's only natural." "It, it's not like that! We exist to give our all for the Supreme Beings, so working hard is only to be expected!" This back and forth went on for a while, and the two of them could not meet in the middle. Momonga decided to cut this sequence of events short. "Then, how about this. In exchange for this reward, continue your loyal service to me. That should do it.".
