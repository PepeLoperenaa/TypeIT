How much did Demiurge understand without knowing Momonga's thoughts? Just then, a look of enlightenment filled Demiurge's face. "I see... so that's what's going." Eh? What's going on? Momonga stopped himself from speaking the words in his heart. As a mortal man, Momonga had no idea what conclusion that Demiurge, intelligent and cunning beyond measure, had come to after his ruminations. All he could do was hope that Demiurge realised his true intentions as his head was covered in nonexistent cold sweat under his helmet. "I believe I have some grasp on your profound schemes, Mo... no, Dark Warrior-sama. Truly, they are considerations that only the ruler of this domain would have taken into account. However, I cannot allow your noble self to proceed unaccompanied. I am aware that it may inconvenience you, but I hope that in your boundless mercy, you will permit one of us to escort you." "...It can't be helped. Very well, I will allow one person to travel with me." Demiurge smiled elegantly. "My deepest thanks for humoring my selfish request, Dark Warrior-sama." "...Just call me Dark Warrior, you can dispense with the honorifics." "How could I! To do so would be unforgivable. Of course, I can obey such an order while acting as a spy or performing special missions, but within the Great Tomb of Nazarick, how could anyone not show the due respect to you, Momonga-sama... no, Dark Warrior-sama!" Demiurge's passionate monologue moved Momonga a little, and he could not help but nod in approval. He mused that being called Dark Warrior would lead people to mock him for having such a lame name, and he lamented picking that alias so casually.
