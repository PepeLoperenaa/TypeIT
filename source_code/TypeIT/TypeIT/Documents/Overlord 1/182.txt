The pain she had never felt before filled her with fear and made her want to throw up. Perhaps vomiting would clear the feeling of nausea that filled her. However, Enri was looking for a way to live, so she had no time to throw up. Although she wanted to abandon her struggle, there was a reason why Enri had not given up until now. That was the warmth pressed against her chest - her younger sister. She had to let her sister live. That sole thought kept Enri from giving in. In contrast, the armored knight in front of her seemed to be mocking Enri's resolve. The raised sword swung down. Perhaps it was because all her energies were concentrated here, or because her brain was working overtime because she was on the verge of life and death, but Enri felt that time was passing very slowly, and she desperately tried to think of some way to save her little sister. However, she could not think of anything. All she could do was use her own body as a shield, letting the blade cleave deeply into herself, in the hope of buying time for her little sister to escape. As long as she had the strength, she would hang on tightly to the knight or the sword he stuck in her, holding on tight and not letting go until the flame of her life guttered out. If she could do that. she would gladly accept her fate. Enri smiled, as though she were a martyr.
