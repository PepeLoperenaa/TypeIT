Momonga turned in the direction Cocytus was looking, at the entrance of the Colosseum, where he saw two figures enter. The one in front was Albedo, while a man followed behind her like a lackey. Once she got close enough, Albedo smiled to Momonga and bowed deeply. The man bowed and said, "Forgive me for keeping everyone waiting." He was about 180cm tall, and his skin was darkened from the sun. His facial features looked to be Oriental, while his jet-black hair was neatly combed back. The eyes under his pince-nez glasses could not even be said to be narrowed. It was doubtful whether they were actually open at all. He was dressed in a Western suit, with a matching tie. He gave the impression of being a professional businessman, or a skilled lawyer. However, his gentlemanly appearance was hard-pressed to hide the evil air about him. A tail sheathed in silvery metal extended behind him, tipped by six sharp spikes. He was limned by flickering black flames. This man was the "Creator of Blazing Inferno", Demiurge. He was the Guardian of the 7th Floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. This demon was designed to be the defense commander of the NPCs. "It seems everyone is here." "-Momonga-sama, there are two more people who have not yet arrived," said a resonant voice that seemed to pour into one's heart. Demiurge's words were empowered by a passive skill. This skill was called [Command Mantra], and it could instantly turn the weak-minded into puppets dancing on Demiurge's strings. However, this skill had no effect on the people present. It was only useful on people below level 40, so to everyone here, it simply sounded good. "No. Those two Guardians are only to be moved under special circumstances. Therefore, there is no need to call them over at the moment."
