The shouts and praise of the NPCs and servants thundered through the Throne Room.    As he basked in the praise of his subordinates Ainz thought My friends what do you think of me using this great name Are you happy Are you displeased If you have any objections please let me know tell me "this is not a name you can take for yourself". I will gladly return to my old name of Momonga.    "Then" Ainz looked out at everyone. "Next I shall announce our new direction. This is an absolute order." Ainz paused here and looked around. The subordinates before him had serious stern looks on their faces. "Make Ainz Ooal Gown an eternal legend." He gripped the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown tightly and rapped it on the ground. Then as though responding to Ainz the crystals socketed on the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown radiated light in all the colors of the rainbow and the air around him trembled.
