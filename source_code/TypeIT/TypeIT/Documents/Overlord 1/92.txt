It was a divineclass item called the Gem of the Moon and the ability Momonga chose Called forth Moonlight Wolves. As the summoning magic took effect three beasts appeared out of thin air. The special effects of the summoning were the same as in YGGDRASIL so Momonga was not surprised by them. Moonlight Wolves looked very similar to Siberian Wolves but they radiated a silver glow. Momonga could feel a mysterious connection between himself and the Moonlight Wolves. It clearly showed who was the master and the servant between them. "Are those Moonlight Wolves" Aura's tone showed she did not understand. After all she had no idea why Momonga would summon such weak monsters. Moonlight Wolves were highly agile and they were useful for ambushes but they were only level 20 or so. They were very weak monsters compared to Aura and Momonga. However monsters of this level were enough for their purposes this time round. In fact the weaker they were the better. "Yes they are. Now include me in the radius of your skill." "Eh Really' "It's fine."
