The phrase "abandoned us" swirled in his mind like a vortex. His past companions had left him for their own reasons. YGGDRASIL was just a game, and they could not abandon their real lives for a game. Momonga felt the same way too. Yet could it really be said that he - who had been fixated on Ainz Ooal Gown and the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick - had not been suppressing his anger toward his former comrades? They abandoned me. "...That might be so, but it might not be. Human emotions are a complicated matter, and there is no right answer. Raise your head, Albedo. I understand your feelings. All right, it's decided... this shall be my name. Until my comrades object, I shall be Ainz Ooal Gown." "Understood. The thought that our most exalted master... and the man I love most would bear this glorious name fills me with joy." The man I love most... ah. The uneasy Ainz decided not to worry about this for now. "...Is that so. I'm glad to hear that." "Then, Ainz-sama, would you like to spend some time here? Although I would be happy to stand by Ainz-sama's side, I... right, a stroll through the woods would be fine too." He could not do that. Ainz had come to save this village. The parents that his sisters had asked him to save were already dead. As he thought of their corpses, he scratched his head. The sight of their bodies reminded him of a dead insect by the roadside. There was no pity, no sadness, no anger. "Hm, well, a stroll might be all right. After all, there is nothing of importance to do. The Death Knight seems to be quite happy to do his job."
