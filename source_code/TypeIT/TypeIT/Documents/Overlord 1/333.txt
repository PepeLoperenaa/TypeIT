OVERLORD VOLUME 1 AFTERWORD Pleased to meet you, dear readers who are reading the afterword. I am the author, Maruyama. This work is a revision of the web novel version of Overlord, with new characters as well as lots of new and edited content. If you have already bought this book, I am glad. If you are browsing this book, I will use my psycho power to make you bring it to the counter and pay for it. Muuun The main character of this book is a skeletal magician who leads a vast evil organization, and he is meant to feel like the final boss of a game. Because of that, those readers who don't believe in saving people without a reward (as is common in LNs or anime) and put themselves first will enjoy this book. Apart from that, while this work has already been on the net for a long time, an important new character was added during the novelization. I would be very happy if everyone were to come to like her. The truth is that I have never written an afterword before. Therefore, allow me to express my sincere thanks next: I am especially grateful to my editor, F-da, whom I gave a lot of trouble, as well as so-bin-sama, who drew these beautiful insert pictures. In addition, I must thank Chord Design Studio, who made this beautiful cover page, as well as Ohaku-sama, who helped correct and revise many things. Thank you very much.
