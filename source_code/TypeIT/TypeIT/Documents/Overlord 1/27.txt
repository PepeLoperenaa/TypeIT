The staff that had been made but never used had finally found its way into its rightful owner's hands, in the twilight hours of YGGDRASIL. Momonga rejoiced as he saw his parameters rising rapidly, but at the same time he felt sad. "Let's go, symbol of the guild. Or no - my symbol of the guild." Part 2 Momonga left what was known as the Round Table Room. Guild members had a ring reserved for their use. Anyone who wore that ring would automatically appear in this place when they logged into the game, barring special circumstances. If any guild members returned, they would do so in this room. However, Momonga knew that the other members of the guild would not be coming back here. In the last few minutes of the game, the only player who remained in the gigantic Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick was Momonga himself. Momonga suppressed the emotions that were rising like a tide, and walked through the halls. This place was like a castle built of alabaster, a magnificent world suffused with a regal atmosphere. If one raised their head to look to the ceiling, they would see crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling at fixed intervals, radiating a warm light. The broad hallways had brilliantly-polished stone floors, which reflected the light from the chandeliers in a way that made it seem like twinkling stars were embedded in its surface. If a visitor opened the doors on both sides of him, his attention would be captivated by the decadent furnishings within. A third party observing this scene would probably be staring in awe.
