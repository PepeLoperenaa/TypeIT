"What're you saying You are the master of Nazarick the Supreme Overlord right Momongasama There's no place you'd be intruding if you visited" "I see... speaking of which if you're here Mare..." Upon hearing Momonga's question Aura blinked in surprise as though she had realised some great truth and turned around shouting loudly upward "Momongasama has graced us with his presence How rude are you going to be by not showing your face to him" There was movement in the shadows of the VIP box. "Was Mare there too" "Yes that's right Momongasama. He's really timid... Oi jump down here now" An almost inaudible reply came from the VIP box. Judging by the distance between there and here it was a miracle the other party could even hear Aura. However that miracle was the result of the magic on Aura's necklace. "I I can't oneechan..." Aura took a deep breath and grabbed her head. "He... he... Momongasama he's just scared he's definitely not trying to insult you." As a member of society one had to know when to speak one's heart and when to say things that were appropriate for the occasion. Momonga nodded and answered in a gentle way to put Aura at ease. "Of course Aura. I have never doubted your loyalty." Aura sighed in relief and then she became serious again before shouting angrily at the VIP box.
