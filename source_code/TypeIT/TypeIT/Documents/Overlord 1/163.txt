"That makes sense... it seems I panicked because I have not seen Momongasama for such a long time. I can only meet Momonga-sama after 18 hours, don't you think 18 hours is too long?" "Yes, it is." "If only I could finish laying out the administrative framework and return to Momonga-sama's side... then I'd better not waste time griping and find Momonga-sama. Where is Momonga-sama now?" "He just stepped out." "I see." Although Albedo's reply seemed curt, there was a distant smile on her face as she imagined being with Momonga, and she flapped her wings in an adorable way. She walked past the Evil Lords with hurried steps. The footsteps suddenly halted, and Albedo asked the Evil Lords again: "For the last time, do you really think Momonga-sama will approve of seeing me dirtied like this?" After leaving the mausoleum, Momonga was greeted by a beautiful sight. The surface area of the Great Tomb of Nazarick was 200 meters square, protected by six-meter thick walls, with an entrance and an exit at the front and back. The Tomb's grass was trimmed short and felt refreshing. On the other hand, the Tomb's trees had leafy branches that shrouded much of the grounds in shade, and the extensive shadows gave the place a gloomy air. There were also alabaster tombstones scattered about. The juxtaposition of the neat grass and the messy tombstones was quite incongruous. In addition, there were exquisite carvings of angels and goddesses all over the place, each of which was easily a work of art, but the chaotic tomb design was frustrating, to say the least.
