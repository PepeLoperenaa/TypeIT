Gazef turned to look at the mumbling Ainz. With a hopeful look on his face, he asked: "Gown-dono, if it is alright with you, would you be willing to let me hire you?" There was no answer, but Gazef could feel the weight of Ainz's gaze beneath the mask. "You may name your price and I will meet it." "...Please permit me to refuse." "...Even the loan of that knight you summoned would be fine." "...I must refuse that as well." "I see... then, what if I conscripted you, in accordance with the Kingdom's laws?" "That would be the worst decision you could make... I did not plan to say such harsh words, but if you insist on using the authority of the Kingdom to conscript me, then I would be compelled to put up a bit of resistance." The two of them looked wordlessly at each other. The first to avert his eyes was Gazef. "...That would be frightening indeed. We would be wiped out before even crossing blades with the gentlemen of the Slaine Theocracy." "Wiped out... well, that's a good joke. However, I am glad you understand me." Gazef narrowed his eyes and looked at Ainz, whose head was nodded in thanks. His words just now were not a joke, Gazef's instincts told him. Making an enemy of this magic caster would be a fatal error.
