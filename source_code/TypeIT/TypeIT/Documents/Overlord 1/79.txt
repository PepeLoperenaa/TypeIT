The colosseum was oval in shape 180 meters on its long axis and 150 meters on the short axis. It was 40 meters tall and modelled after the arenas of the Roman Empire. Continual Light spells were cast everywhere illuminating the grounds in white light so one could observe the entire Colosseum like it was day. The audience was composed of many clay dolls  golems in other words  which showed no sign of activity. In this Colosseum the intruders would be the stars of the show while the ones watching from the VIP box would be members of Ainz Ooal Gown. The main event of course would be a brutal melee. Apart from the 1500man invasion every single invader had met their end here. Momonga walked into the center of the arena and looked into the sky. What he saw was a black expanse of night sky. Perhaps he might have been able to see the stars if there were no light around him. However this place was the 6th floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick so the sky there was merely a virtual imitation. Even that imitation required a massive amount of data but as a result the sky here could change with the time of day even showing an actual sun with appropriate daylight effects. Momonga could relax himself in this virtual landscape because Momonga's heart remained that of a human as opposed to his skeletal appearance. It was also because he felt a sense of appreciation for his comrades' hard work in building this place. Part of him wanted to just wait and space out here but the present situation denied him that luxury. Momonga looked around  nobody was there. The twins should have been minding this place... He noticed something.
