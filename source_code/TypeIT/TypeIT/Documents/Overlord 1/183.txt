As a big sister, this was all she could do for Nemu. The thought made Enri smile. Could Nemu escape the hell that was Carne Village by herself? Even if she fled into the forest, she might run into patrols of soldiers. However, as long as she could survive, there was a possibility of escape. In order to give her little sister the chance to survive, Enri would bet her life - no, she would bet everything. That said, the idea of being hurt again frightened her, so she closed her eyes. In this world of darkness, she prepared herself for the pain that would come- Part 3 Momonga sat on a chair and looked at the mirror before him. The roughly onemeter wide mirror did not reflect Momonga's face, but a patch of grass. The mirror was like a television set, showing images of a distant plain. The grass of the plains swayed in the wind, proving it was not a still image. As time passed, the sun slowly rose, its light banishing the darkness that covered the plains. This pastoral scene, almost poetic in its beauty, was a stark difference from the former location of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, the desolate world of Helheim. Momonga reached out to the mirror and swiped his hand right. The mirror's image changed. This was a Mirror of Remote Viewing. This was a magic item used to display an image of a specific region. It was a very useful item for player-killers, or player-killer-killers. However, there were low-level spells which occluded information-gathering spells that could hide people from the mirror's eyes. In addition, it was easy for users to be counterattacked by offensive barriers, so it was an average item at best. However, for the present circumstances, an item which could show the outside world was a very useful item indeed.
