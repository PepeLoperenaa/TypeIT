One of the Dragonkin picked up another strawman and placed it beside the burned one. Momonga paced around the strawman before casting a spell on it "Napalm." A column of flame appeared beside the strawman engulfing it in fire. Momonga paused a beat then cast another spell on the remnants of the strawman " Fireball." The fireball struck the remains of the strawman scattering its ashes in a puff of smoke. The recast time between spells was the same as in YGGDRASIL. The actual process of casting was faster than in YGGDRASIL. Previously in order to cast an areaeffect spell he would need to choose the spell then move the areaeffect cursor over the desired area. The process now was quicker than that. "Perfect" Momonga said his voice filled with the same satisfaction he felt in his heart. "Momongasama should I prepare more strawmen" Aura still did not understand. She was already aware that Momonga was a mighty magic caster so she did not feel the show before her was anything special. However that was the impression Momonga wanted to give them and from the look on the twins' faces it would seem he had succeeded. "...No there is no need. I wish to try something else." After rejecting Aura's suggestion Momonga began his next experiment. " Message."
