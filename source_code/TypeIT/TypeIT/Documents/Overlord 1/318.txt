After all, he managed to put together a sensible, coherent plan in a short period of time; perhaps this was his leadership talent at work. Just then, Albedo's cheerful voice entered Ainz's self-satisfied ears: "...Still, was it necessary to take the angels' swords with your precious body, Ainz-sama?" "Is that how it looked to you? When we first came to Carne Village, we used the knights on the outskirts to verify that my High-Tier Physical Nullification was still working normally." "Indeed, you are correct. I verified it with my own eyes as well. However, I did not wish my eyes to helplessly watch the swords of those despicable angels piercing your body, Ainz-sama." "I see. Though you were my shield, I did not take your feelings into consideration. You have my-" "-And even if I knew you would emerge unscathed, which woman would want to see the man she loves being stabbed by swords?" "...Ah, yes." Ainz did not know how to answer, so he let it slide as he continued to the village. Albedo did not seem to want to press the matter and followed quietly. Once they reached the village, the villagers, led by the Death Knight, came out to meet them. They lavished praise and thanks onto them, and Ainz saw Gazef among the villagers.
