The neighs of horses. The screams of people and shouts. These sounds were becoming clearer and clearer. In the distance Enri could see an unfamiliar man in armor swinging his sword at a villager. The villager collapsed to the ground with a howl of pain like a puppet whose strings had been cut and a swift thrust from the sword dealt him a fatal blow. "Morgasan..." There were no strangers in a small village like this. Everyone was as close as kin. As such Enri knew exactly who had been killed before her eyes. Mr. Morga was a loud but pleasant man. He had done nothing wrong and did not deserve to die like this. Enri wanted to stop  but in the end she gritted her teeth and ran on. The distance that felt fairly close while carrying water now felt like an endless stretch. As the sounds of shouts and cursing filtered into her ears she finally saw her home before her. "Dad Mom Nemu" Enri opened the door as she shouted for her family. She found three familiar faces with unfamiliar looks of fear. They were motionless. However when Enri opened the door and entered their faces softened the fear replaced by relief. "Enri Are you all right" Her father hugged her in his strong arms which were brawny and tough from field work. "Ahhh Enri..." Her mother's gentle arms embraced her.
