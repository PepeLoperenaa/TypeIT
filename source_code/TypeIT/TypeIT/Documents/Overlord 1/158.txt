Once they had gotten close enough to each other all the demons simultaneously genuflected bowing their heads to him. The one at their head was of course Demiurge. His neat movements were slick and elegant as though he were a nobleman. "Momongasama. May I ask why you have come here without your escort and dressed like this" The cat was out of the bag. Demiurge could be said to be the wisest being in The Great Tomb of Nazarick so being seen through was inevitable. However Momonga felt that the reason he had been seen through was because of the teleportation. Only one person in Nazarick possessed the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown that permitted its bearer to teleport freely through its halls  Momonga. "Ah... it's complicated. Demiurge you should know why I am wearing this." Demiurge's elegant face twisted in consternation. He took several breaths before answering "My deepest apologies for being unable to divine your fathomless intentions Momongasama" "Call me Dark Warrior." "Pardon me Dark Warriorsama..." Demiurge seemed to have something to say but Momonga tried his best to ignore it. Although it was a pretty embarrassing name it made sense when one considered the names of other monsters in the game. The reason behind having Demiurge address him by a different name was quite simple. Although only Demiurge and his vassals were here at the moment this place was an exit and many underlings would be passing through here. Momonga simply did not want them to call him "Momongasama Momongasama" wherever he went.
