Momonga was not sure how to proceed given the changes in Albedo. The next step... yes, the final step. If he could confirm that, then all of his predictions would be vindicated. Was this real life, or was this just fantasy? He had to do this. If she attacked him with that weapon of hers, it could not be helped. "Albedo... I, may I touch your breasts?" "Eh?"

As Momonga convinced himself with all his strength, his composure gradually returned to him. Resuming the air of a proper ruler, he continued forcefully: "That... should be fine, right?"
