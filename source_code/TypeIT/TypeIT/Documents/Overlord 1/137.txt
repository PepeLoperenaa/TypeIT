The reason why there were no pop monsters on the 9th Floor was simply because if any intruders could overcome the NPC defenders of the 8th Floor the most powerful beings in the Tomb then Ainz Ooal Gown's chances of victory would be slim. Thus it would be better to play the role of a villain to the hilt and meet the invaders in the throne room for a final showdown. "...It will be fine. Because it's an emergency we need extra hands for security." "Understood. I shall select only the finest and most potent troops for this duty." Momonga nodded and looked toward the twins. "Aura and Mare... can you conceal the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick Simple illusions don't seem very reliable and thinking about the cost of illusions gives me a headache." Aura and Mare looked at each other and began thinking. After a while Mare spoke up "Uusing magic might be tricky. If we had to hide everything along with the surface... although we could cover the walls in mud and then add plants as camouflage." "Do you intend to soil the glorious walls of Nazarick with base dirt" Albedo said that with her back turned to Mare. Although her voice was sweet and velvet the tone it carried was anything but. Mare's shoulders trembled and although the surrounding Guardians remained silent their attitudes suggested that they shared Albedo's opinion. In contrast Momonga felt Albedo was being too much of a busybody. The situation was hardly serious enough to warrant such a reaction. "Albedo... don't speak out of turn. I am addressing Mare." His voice was so deep that it surprised Momonga himself.
