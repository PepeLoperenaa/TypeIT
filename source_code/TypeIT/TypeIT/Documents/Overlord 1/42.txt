All Momonga knew about her character was that she was the Overseer of the Guardians as well as the highestranked NPC in Nazarick. Driven by curiosity Momonga opened up a console and began scrolling through the details of Albedo's flavor text. A flood of denselypacked characters filled his vision. It was like reading an ancient epic poem. If he took his time to read it in detail he would probably still be reading until the game ended. Momonga felt like he had stepped on a land mine. If he could move he would be trembling now. He wanted to scold himself for having forgotten that Albedo's creator was obsessed with this sort of thing. However since he had already opened it he had no choice but to abandon his resistance and continue scrolling. He didn't even skim the text for the important points he simply scrolled to the bottom as fast as he could while looking at the title. After skipping past vast expanses of text Momonga's mind settled on the last line and froze. "She is also a slut." He could not help but stare. "...Eh What does this mean" A cry of disbelief escaped Momonga's nonexistent lips. He looked the words over several more times eyes filled with suspicion but in the end he could not find any other meaning to them. After several rounds of thought he could only come to the conclusion he had started with. "A slut... meaning she has excessive sexual desire"
