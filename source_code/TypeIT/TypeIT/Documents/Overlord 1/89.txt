As Aura noticed Momonga's strange reaction, she hurriedly dispersed the scent with her hand. Among Aura's skills as a Beast Tamer, there were certain passive skills that had buffing and debuffing effects. These abilities acted through her breath and had a radius of several meters, some even up to ten meters. With the effect of certain skills, that radius could be enlarged to unbelievable proportions. In YGGDRASIL, icons representing buffs and debuffs appeared in one's field of vision, so one could see if they were under the effect of an ability. However, no indication of these changes appeared before him, which made things quite troublesome. "Ah, it should be fine now, I cancelled it!" "Is that so..." "...Although you're undead, so mind-affecting effects shouldn't work on you, right, Momonga-sama?" That was true in YGGDRASIL. The undead were immune to mind-affecting effects, whether positive or negative. "...Was I within the effective radius?" "Mm." Aura lowered her head in fear, and so did Mare beside her. "...I'm not angry, Aura," Momonga said in as gentle a voice as he could manage. "Aura... You don't have to be so afraid. Do you think such a simple skill would inconvenience me? I was simply asking if I was within the effective range of your skill." "Yes! Just now, you were within range of my skill." After hearing Aura's energetic answer as relief flooded back into her, Momonga realized that his very presence filled Aura with fear.
