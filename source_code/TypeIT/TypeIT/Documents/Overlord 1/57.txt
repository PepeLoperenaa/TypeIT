Just as Momonga was about to cry out the words of one of his guild members came to mind Panic is the seed of defeat so you must maintain your calm and think logically. Remain calm look beyond your surroundings and don't waste your effort on unnecessary details Momongasan. As he recalled these words Momonga slowly regained his composure. Momonga silently thanked Punitto Moe the Zhuge Liang of Ainz Ooal Gown. "Is something the matter" She was close to him now. Albedo was so close he could feel her gentle breaths. Her lovely face dimpled in an adorable way as she asked her question. Momonga who had calmed himself after much effort was in danger of being driven into panic again from her nearby face. "...The GM Call function does not seem to work." Entranced by Albedo's limpid eyes Momonga could not help but question the NPC. In Momonga's past life he had not received romantic attention from the opposite sex let alone those of a sexual nature. Although he knew that she was just an NPC he could not help but be moved by her realistic expressions and movements. However as his passions stirred within his heart they were quenched like they had been earlier and he returned to normal. Momonga felt uneasy at the lack of strong emotions within himself and he wondered if it was related to the words of his comrade from just now. But was that really the case Momonga shook his head. Now was not the time to ponder these things.
