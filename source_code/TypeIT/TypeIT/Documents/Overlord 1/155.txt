In any case it was not a good sign that he the master of Nazarick was being subjected to this emotional distress amidst these strange circumstances. It might lead to him making a poor decision in times of emergency. He needed to refresh himself. Momonga's eyes went wide as he came to that decision. His expression did not change of course but the lights in his eyes burned brighter. "No... there is no need for the guards to accompany me. I simply wish to walk by myself." "Plplease wait and reconsider if something happens to Momongasama we must become your shields. We cannot allow any harm to come to your person." The maids and the other vassals wanted nothing more than to protect their master even at the cost of their own lives. In that sense Momonga's request to go walking by himself  which completely disregarded their feelings  was a cruel one. However it had been over three days since this abnormality occurred roughly 73 hours. In this time Momonga had been desperately trying to maintain the stern facade of the ruler of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick but now he needed a rest. Therefore even though he felt bad for them Momonga thought of an excuse and said "...I have to do something in secret and I will not allow anyone to follow me." A brief silence followed. Just as Momonga was starting to feel that it was dragging on the maid finally replied "Understood. Then please be safe Momongasama."
