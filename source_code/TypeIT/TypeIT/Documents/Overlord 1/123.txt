"That... er well that seems okay sort of." After agreeing with Aura's take two Shalltear placed her slender hands on the sides of Momonga's head as though to embrace it. "Ah my master my beloved master the only one whom I cannot rule over..." Her carmine lips parted revealing a moist slick tongue. The tongue moved like a living creature as Shalltear lovingly licked her lips. Her fragrant breath wafted out from her open mouth. Although she was perfectly suited for the role of an alluring seductress in all other ways she was far too young for it. The gap between her expectations and reality was laughable. In addition she was far too short. When she reached her hands out to hug Momonga it looked like she wanted to hang from his neck instead. However this was too much affection for Momonga who was not used to girls. He wanted to take a step back but in the end he decided to stand his ground. Is that how she really is That thought echoed endlessly in his head. However when Momonga thought about the fact that she had been designed by his comrade Peroroncino he mused that she might have been designed with such a personality. After all Peroroncino loved Hgames and proudly declared that they were his life. Shalltear Bloodfallen was made by such a rotten individual. She was a "True Vampire" the Guardian of the 1st to 3rd floors of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. At the same time she was a girl created by a Hgame aficionado and her character design was filled with nods to various Hgames. "...That's enough out of you..." Shalltear reacted to the low growl for the first time. In a mocking tone she told Aura "Ara are you still here shorty I couldn't see you so I thought you were gone."
