Yet these two Dark Elf children were displaying animated emotions in front of Momonga. "They must be the Aura and Mare that Bukubukuchagamasan wanted to see." Bukubukuchagama was the guild member who had designed these two Dark Elf characters. If only she could have been here for this... "I I'm sorry I kept you waiting Momongasama..." He nervously raised his eyes to peek at Momonga. He wore a vest of blue dragon scales and a small cape that was as green as jungle leaves. His clothes had the same basic white color as Aura but a short section of flesh peeked out below his short skirt. It was short because the rest of his legs were covered in white silk stockings. He had an acornshaped pendant on a necklace like Aura but his was made of silver. Mare was much more lightly armed than Aura with a pair of lustrous white gloves on his dainty little hands and a gnarled black staff in his hands. Mare Bello Fiore. Like Aura he was a Guardian of the Sixth Floor of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. Momonga squinted  though his eyes were merely empty sockets  and looked at them. Aura thrust her chest forward proudly while Mare simply cowered under Momonga's gaze. He nodded several times musing that the two of them were indeed the incarnation of his comrade's hard work. "I'm glad to see that the two of you are in good spirits."
