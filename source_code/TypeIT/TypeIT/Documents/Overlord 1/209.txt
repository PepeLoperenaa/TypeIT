"Money I'll give you money 200 gold pieces No 500 gold pieces" Those were considerable amounts he was talking about. However right now it was like telling them that he would pay them to jump off a 500meter cliff. Although nobody responded one person  no half a person moved as though in reply to him. "Uboooooarrr..." The right half of the bisected corpse gripped Belius' ankles firmly. The bloody gargling from its mouth hardly sounded like words. "Ogyaaaaaahhhhh" Belius screamed in an unnaturally highpitched voice. The onlooking knights and villagers were frozen in fear their skin covered in goosebumps. Squire Zombies. In YGGDRASIL creatures killed by the Death Knight would become undead of comparable power haunting the place where they were killed. According to the game's rules those damned souls who fell to the Death Knight's blade would become its slaves for all eternity. Belius stopped screaming and fell like a puppet whose strings had been cut facing the sky. He must have passed out. The Death Knight drew closer to the defenseless man and stabbed its wavyblade flamberge down. Belius' body twitched and "Guguwaaaaaaargh" Woken by the incredible pain Belius screamed "Leh leh me guh Ah beggehg yeh Ah duh anythuh" Using both hands Belius desperately grabbed the flamberge that had already penetrated his body but the Death Knight paid his futile struggles no heed and worked the flamberge like a saw. His flesh and armor were cruelly torn open and fresh blood flew everywhere.
