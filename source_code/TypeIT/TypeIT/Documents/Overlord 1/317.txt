Ainz could not help but feel nostalgic. If only I had learned some information-type spells - Ainz thought, with a hint of regret. Of course, he did not know if those spells could be used here. However, if he could, then he would not have to be as nervous as he was now. Still, there was no point worrying about what he did not have. Ainz decided to think of something else: "...I know your strength, Albedo, and I trust you. However, I would like you to discard such shallow thinking and remember that an enemy who is stronger than myself could appear at any time. This is especially true given that we do not quite understand this world... so I hoped Gazef could do our work for us." "I see... so you used him as a pawn to feel out the enemy's strength. It is quite fitting to use inferior lifeforms like humans in that way." Although the closed helm revealed none of her emotions, her freshly-flowered joy was obvious in her voice. Ainz had been a human in the past, and now he was undead. Since just now, he had sensed that Albedo hated humans very much . However, it did not upset him or make him feel depressed. Rather, he felt that such thoughts were quite suitable for the inhuman Guardian Overseer of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. "...Indeed. However, that is not all. Since we saved him at the brink of death, he will be even more grateful to us. In addition, since the enemy was a special forces unit, the country's higher-ups will not investigate the matter too openly. That was why I stepped in." "Ah... as expected of Ainz-sama... so that was why you took the commander and the others alive. Marvellously done!"
