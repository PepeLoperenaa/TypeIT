Of course Ainz did not fully trust them. After all mouths that were sealed by the promise of benefits could be opened by bigger benefits. If he tried to play on their personalities to keep them quiet the vagaries of human nature might make them talk. No method was better than the other so all Ainz could do was take a chance and hope that the chief's character would not let him reveal the secret. Although it would be fine even if he did. That betrayal would simply be more leverage Ainz could use in future dealings with the village. However Ainz's instincts told him that they would not betray him. After seeing the earnest gratitude of the chief and his wife he believed that they would be loyal. "Then... can you tell me more about this place"    "...What what is this" "Urk Is something the matter" "No it's fine. I was simply speaking to myself. Forgive me for alarming you." Ainz recovered in an instant and immediately covered himself up. If his body were still human he would be sweating buckets by now. The chief simply said "Is that so" and did not ask further. Perhaps the chief had already equated "magic casters" with "weirdos". Then again that was better for Ainz... "Shall I prepare a drink for you" "Oh no I'm not thirsty. Please don't trouble yourself." His wife was no longer in the room but outside  there were many things she had to help with. Only Ainz and the chief were in the house now.
