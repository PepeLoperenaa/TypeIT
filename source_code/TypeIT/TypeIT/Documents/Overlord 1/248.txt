wore leather armor and some did not have their plate armor on exposing the chainmail underneath. Some of them wore helmets while some went bareheaded. About the only thing they had in common was that they each showed their faces. All of them had swords of similar make but apart from that they also carried bows javelins maces and other backup weapons. One could say that they looked like hardened veterans of the battlefield. A less polite way would be to say that they were a ragtag bunch of sellswords. The riders finally entered the square. There were around 20 of them and while they were wary of the Death Knight they formed up neatly before Ainz and the village chief. A man stepped forward from the rest of the force. He seemed to be the leader of the horsemen. He looked like the fiercest and most eyecatching one of his men. The leader's eyes rested briefly upon the village chief before lingering on the Death Knight and then he turned toward Albedo. He took a long time looking at her. However once he satisfied himself that none of them were going to move he immediately turned his keen gaze on Ainz. Although the man looking at him seemed to be the sort who made his living by violence Ainz remained still. A look like that could not hope to raise any ripples on the still lake of Ainz's heart. It was not because Ainz did not fear those eyes but because of his undead body. Perhaps he was full of confidence because he could use his powers from YGGDRASIL. Once satisfied the leader spoke in a grave tone "I am the WarriorCaptain of the ReEstize Kingdom Gazef Stronoff. By order of the King I have been visiting each of the frontier villages to exterminate knights from enemy countries who have been making trouble here."
