"When a monster shows up the rank and file soldiers are hardpressed to deal with it. If a village does not have the money to hire adventurers to deal with monsters all they can do is hunker down and wait for the monster to leave." "...That's right." "Then can you say you did not look forward to something like this Can you say you did not hope for the nobles or someone strong to come and save you" "...It would be a lie to say that I didn't. But the fact is that nobody ever came forward to help. At least the lord of the land where my village was didn't pay for adventurers to help us." "Since that is the case... why don't we prove that we're not like him Come let us save these people." The ViceCaptain thought of his own experiences and could not say anything in response. "ViceCaptain let's show the villagers what heroes who willingly plunge into danger to save others look like. Let's show them how the strong will save the weak." Gazef's eyes met the ViceCaptain's and countless emotions passed in between them. His voice somewhat tired but grateful the ViceCaptain replied "...Then allow me to lead the men. There are many who can replace me but none who can take the place of the WarriorCaptain." "Don't be foolish. My chances of survival are higher. Remember we're not going to die but to save the people of the Kingdom." The ViceCaptain opened his mouth several times as though to speak but in the end he chose to remain silent. "Then pick the soldiers who will escort the villagers to ERantel with you."
