"...Eh" It felt wrong. He thought that but Ainz could not find any reason to refute her. "Then it should be fine right" Albedo said again. Ainz could sense something mysterious and inscrutable in those words and he brought up a question in a final desperate attempt to struggle free "I messed with Tabulasan's character settings. Don't you wish to go back to your old self" "I believe Tabulasama would approve with all the joy of giving his daughter away for marriage." "...Is is that so" Was he really like that Just as Ainz was thinking about this the sound of crashing metal rang out. He turned to look at the source of the sound and saw a longsword on the ground. The Death Knight who should have been holding that sword was nowhere to be seen. He had summoned the missing Death Knight not long ago. "...When I summon them normally they disappear after a while... given the way the sword from this world is on the ground it would seem that equipment alone was not enough to bind them to this world so it was left behind. If that is the case does that Death Knight remain here because I used a corpse to summon it It would appear that I can strengthen Nazarick if I had more corpses." "Then shall we collect a large number of corpses for you"
