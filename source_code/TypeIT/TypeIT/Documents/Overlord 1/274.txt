The sole weapon of Gazef's beleaguered men  their hope for victory  was gone. After unconsciously evading an incoming sword Gazef counterattacked and destroyed an angel in one hit. However the enemy he was aiming for was still far away. Although his subordinates hoped otherwise they needed magic weapons to break through the angels' damage reduction. They did not know how to use the Focus Battle Aura martial art like Gazef could and without magic weapons even if Gazef's men could injure the angels they could not finish them off. They were at their wits' end.    Gazef bit his lip and continued slashing. His record for the most consecutive uses of his ultimate attack Sixfold Slash of Light was rapidly increasing. A warrior like Gazef could use six different kinds of martial arts at once and combined with his hidden ultimate attack that made seven martial arts at once. Until now he had been using martial arts to improve his physical attributes fortify his mind improve his magic resistance temporarily render his weapon magical as well as another technique that he used on hitting an opponent. That made five martial arts. The reason why he had not pushed himself to the limit and used all seven at once was because powerful martial arts depleted one's concentration. In particular the Sixfold Slash of Light required three times the focus of his other techniques. Gazef had two ultimate attacks like this but he could only use them with four other martial arts at the same time.
