"...Which is why everyone should walk the path of the righteous teachings together. Humanity should not fight amongst itself but work hand in hand to bring about a better and brighter future." Gazef would be the sacrifice for that. "...Can we kill him" Nigun did not mock his subordinate's unease. Their prey was the Kingdom's WarriorCaptain  the strongest man in the region Gazef Stronoff. Eliminating him would be more difficult than attacking and exterminating the inhabitants of a huge goblin village. In order to dispel his underlings' fear Nigun calmly replied "It will be fine. Right now he does not possess any of the Kingdom's treasures the ones which he is permitted to bear. Without them killing him will be a piece of cake... no it would be better to say that without them this is our only chance to kill him." The Kingdom's WarriorCaptain Gazef Stronoff was famed as the strongest fighter in the land. But there was a reason for that reputation beyond his extraordinary swordsmanship. That reason was the five heirlooms of the Kingdom. Although only four of them were known he was permitted to bear all of them. The Gauntlets of Vitality that made their user immune to fatigue. The Amulet of Immortality which constantly regenerated his wounds. The Guardian Armor made of adamantite and enchanted to ward off critical hits. Razor's Edge the sword created and enchanted in pursuit of sharpness which could slice through armor like the proverbial hot knife through butter. Even Nigun could not hope to triumph in a headon attack against Gazef Stronoff whose offensive and defensive ability increased astronomically when he used those items. No it might well be that no human could defeat him
