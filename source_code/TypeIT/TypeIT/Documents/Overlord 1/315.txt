Part 2 As he walked along the nightveiled plains Ainz raised his head. What greeted him was the beautiful sight of stars in the sky. Ainz sighed at the scenery for the second time and then he headed back to the village. He had gone a little overboard. As long as Albedo was by his side he could not afford to appear useless to her. As her master he needed to act in a fitting manner in front of his subordinates. While he might have gone a bit too far it still fit the role he was playing. He did not know if he had passed or failed but it would be fine as long as Albedo was not disappointed. Ainz could not see Albedo's expression of "Damn Ainzsama was so cool kufufufu" under her closed helmet. Since he could not tell what she was thinking he went over the day's proceedings once more. "Still Ainzsama why did you save Gazef" Why indeed Ainz could not articulate his feelings at that time so he tried to approximate them for her "This was a problem we caused so shouldn't we try and settle it ourselves" "Then why did you give him that item" "I was laying the foundation for future plans. Letting him hold it would be a good thing for me."
