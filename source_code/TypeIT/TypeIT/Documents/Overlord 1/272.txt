Gazef's men were soon plunged into dire straits. As he had expected more than half of his men were fighting desperately for their lives. The spells of the magic casters only made things that much worse for them. His men fell to the ground one after the other. Gazef averted his eyes and ran forward again. His target was the enemy commander. He did not think the enemy would retreat if their commander went down but that was the only way to save everyone. Over 30 angels put themselves in the charging Gazef's way. He frowned as he saw the heavy defenses ahead of him. "Out of my way" Gazef activated his trump card. Heat bloomed from his hands and spread to envelop his entire body. Gazef broke the limits of his physical body and stepped into the realm of heroes. In addition he activated several martial arts at once  one could call those a warrior's magic. Gazef glared at the six angels surrounding him. "Sixfold Slash of Light"  This was a martial art that struck as fast as light. In one move he hit the six angels around him. All six of them were cut in half dissolving into motes of light. The reinforcements from the Slaine Theocracy gasped in surprise while Gazef's men cheered.
