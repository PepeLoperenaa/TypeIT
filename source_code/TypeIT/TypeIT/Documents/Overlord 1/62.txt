The problem was actually contacting them. Normally simply using the shout command or a GM call would put him in touch with a GM instantly but if these methods did not work either... "Message" This was a spell used to communicate in the game. Normally its use was restricted to certain places and conditions but perhaps he might be able to make good use of this spell in this current situation. The problem was that this spell was originally designed to communicate with other players so it might not be able to reach a GM. And in this extraordinary situation there was no guarantee that the spell would work either. "...However..." He had to give it a try. Momonga was a level 100 spellcaster. If he could not cast spells his mobility his ability to gather information and of course his fighting power would plummet drastically. In these unknown circumstances he had to verify that he could use magic and quickly. Now where can I go to test my magic... As Momonga thought about that question he looked slowly around the Throne Room and then shook his head. Although this was an emergency situation he had no desire to conduct magical experiments in this quiet almost sacred Throne Room. He contemplated suitable locations for magical testing and then a promising location appeared in his mind. In addition to his own abilities he wanted to confirm one more thing. He wanted to make sure of his authority. He had to know whether his powers and privileges as the guildmaster of Ainz Ooal Gown still existed.
