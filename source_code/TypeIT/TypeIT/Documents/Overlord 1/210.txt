"Aah eeeh ah gib ya munni leh leh meh guh" Belius' body shuddered and then he breathed his last. Only then was the Death Knight satisfied and it stepped away from Belius' corpse. "No... no... please no..." "Oh god" Their screams came from seeing the ghastly sight before them. If they ran they would die swiftly but if they stayed they would die horribly. They knew that perfectly well but still they could not bring themselves to move. "Get a grip" Londes' shout tore through their wailing. The world was filled with silence as though time was standing still. "Fall back Sound the horn for the horsemen and archers to come here The rest of you do your best to buy some time for the hornblower I'd rather not die like that if you don't mind Now move" Everyone moved in an instant. There was no sign of their earlier panic. Everyone moved in silent unison like a raging waterfall. Their mechanical obedience to their orders without thinking created a miracle. There was no way they could move so immaculately again. The knights each did what they were supposed to do. They had to protect the knight who would blow the horn and signal the others. One of the soldiers who had taken several steps back lowered his sword and withdrew his horn from his bag. "OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
