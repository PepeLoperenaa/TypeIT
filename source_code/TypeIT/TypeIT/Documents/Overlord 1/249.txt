His even baritone echoed through the village square, and there was some commotion from the chief's house behind Ainz. "The Kingdom's Warrior-Captain..." Won't anyone tell me what's going on? Ainz thought as he spoke to the chief, his voice carrying a hint of rebuke: "...What sort of man is he?" "According to the traders, he was a man who claimed the championship of the martial arts tournament held before the King, and now he leads the elite warriors who are loyal to the King." "Is the man before us truly so amazing...?" "...I do not know. All I heard were stories." Ainz looked closely, and he saw that each of the horsemen had the same emblems on their chests, which resembled what the chief had said about the Kingdom's emblems. That said, he did not have enough reliable information to be sure. Gazef looked at the chief and said, "You must be the chief of this village. Can you tell me who is the person beside you?" Ainz interrupted the chief, who was about to answer, before nodding to Gazef and introducing himself. "There is no need for that. Pleased to meet you, Warrior-Captain-dono of the Kingdom. My name is Ainz Ooal Gown, and I am a magic caster. This village was attacked by knights, and so I stepped in to rescue them." Gazef immediately dismounted, his armor clattering loudly as he did. He bowed deeply once he was on the ground. "Thank you for saving this village. I have no words that can adequately praise your kindness."
