Momonga set his watch to count out the seconds. [23:59:48, 49, 50] Momonga closed his eyes. [23:59:58, 59-] The countdown finished. He waited for the curtains to fall on his fantasy world- He waited for the automatic logout- [0:00:00...1,2,3] "...Hm?" Momonga opened his eyes. He had not returned to his familiar room. This was still the Throne Room in YGGDRASIL. "What's going on?" The time was right. He should have been forcibly logged out by the server shutdown. [0:00:38] It was definitely past midnight. The clock could not have gone wrong because of a system error. A confused Momonga looked around him, searching for any clues in the vicinity. "Could it be they delayed the server shutdown-?" Or had they extended play time as a form of compensation?
