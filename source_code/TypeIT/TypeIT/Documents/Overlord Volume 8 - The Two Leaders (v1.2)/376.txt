"Thank you very much! Thank you very, very much!" "Although it might be troublesome, please tell me the details of her request. This isn't a formal acceptance of the request, but rather, it's so that it's easier for me to take action should the situation call for it." "I understand! I'll go get the details from her right away! Then, please excuse me!" The receptionist fled from the room at top speed, as though a typhoon had passed through. "...Even if you want to gain my sympathy, please don't scold innocent people. It upsets me." "...As I thought, I can't put anything past you, Momon-kun." The guildmaster's sincere reply told Ainz that his hypothesis had been correct. It seems the tricks of the Japanese salaryman can be used anywhere. Then, the question is- The image of Lupusregina appeared in Ainz's mind. How did Lupusregina not know of the monsters that a village girl like Enri was aware of? Was there a failure in establishing an information network? I need to check this out. I have to return to Nazarick soon, Ainz thought as he awaited the receptionist's report.
