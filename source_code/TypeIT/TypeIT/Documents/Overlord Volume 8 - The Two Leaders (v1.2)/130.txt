"Then, where do you plan to sell them?" "I was planning to sell them at the former residence of Madam Bareare." "Bareare? You mean the pharmacist Lizzie Bareare?" Although she didn't live there any more, she had been the most important person in E-Rantel's pharmaceutical business until recently. If she was selling the herbs at Lizzie's place, that meant Lizzie trusted her very much. Then, there's no need to pry deeper, the soldiers thought. The truth was that although their job was to stop dangerous things from entering the city, investigating these things once they entered the city was no longer their problem. The soldier nodded with a grunt, and watched Enri's expression. Up till now, their conversation hadn't been suspicious, and he didn't feel that she was lying. Which meant that after the cargo inspection was complete, his job would be over. At this moment, the soldier who had just returned nodded his head.
