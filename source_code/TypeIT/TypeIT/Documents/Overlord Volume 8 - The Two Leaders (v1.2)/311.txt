His sister liked to jump down to the colosseum from the audience seats, but Mare didn't. The stairs were there for a reason and using them seemed like a show of loyalty to the Supreme Beings. They probably intended for the stairs to be used. I can't say that to sister... She'd give me a scary glare... So he decided that at least he would not let the generosity of the Supreme Beings go to waste and went down through the stairs. Beyond the waiting room, there was a figure standing in front of the mirror that sparkled in seven different colours. "D-did you wait long?" "Oh oh! Isn't it the floor guardian, Mare-sama! For you to come here personally, I am honoured." The clown, dressed in a pure white costume with a mask shaped like a bird's beak, bowed to Mare, who did the same. "Hello, Pulcinella-san. What are you here for?" "Well, I don't know if you're aware or not, but I'm currently working under Demiurge-sama's orders. Today, I came as Demiurge-sama's messenger. Please, take this." The clown handed over the folder he was holding. "If it's from Demiurge-san, is this the memo folder?"
