"Is that so... Of course..." He wanted to tell the magic caster to stop talking to himself, but Ainz waited for him to speak. "I thought she was a simple countryside girl, but she was carrying a powerful magic item in the shape of a horn. So I was going to find out how she came into possession of such a powerful item among other things." "What kind of horn was it? And its effects?" "The effects were-" Ainz looked up into the sky after hearing the whole story. He wanted to avoid the situation because he realized he had given that item to her. He had given Enri that item for her to protect herself, without knowing that this kind of item was abnormal in this world. He did not imagine that it would cause her trouble. He could make excuses, saying that it was not his fault, but he could not just abandon her either. Should I help? I'm not at fault, the one who has the item should be responsible... But it'd be troublesome if that item went into someone else's hands. Plus, if she gets arrested... Nfirea knew that Ainz and Momon were the same person. If he heard about this situation from her later on, he would think that Ainz had abandoned her. There's definitely going to be a problem... It doesn't matter what happens to other useless humans, but he's a valuable one. There's a saying, "turn obstacles into opportunities". If I help her, Nfirea will be thankful and I'll be able to chain him down with obligation.
