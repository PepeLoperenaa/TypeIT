Hearing Paipo's question, Kiumei bowed to Enri from on top of his wolf while replying, "Something's happened in the forest." "...what?" "I'm not too sure, but I think it's like before. A whole bunch of unknown guys are moving towards the north." "Are they knights?" Enri unwittingly interrupted the two of them. Even though she was powerless to change anything, she still could not ignore the conversation. She still could not forget her fear when the village had been attacked. The "whole lot of unknown guys heading north" they talked about was referring to the tracks they found of thousands of people on the march to the north. Although the prints were similar in size to those of humans, they were made by bare feet, so in the end they had concluded that those people were not humans. "I don't have any conclusive evidence, but I think it's different from that time. If you ask me, I'd say something's happening deep inside the forest." "Is that so." Hearing that, Enri couldn't help but sigh in relief. "...Then, I'd better go report to the boss." "All right. Thanks for your hard work."
