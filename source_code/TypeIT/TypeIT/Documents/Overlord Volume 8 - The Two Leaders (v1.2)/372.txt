"About that... well, by the rules, we're not allowed to disclose the details." "Even so, I still need your help. I know this is unfair of me, and I know that rules exist for a reason. But still, I hope that you-" Ainz lowered his head, and the guildmaster crossed his arms. He stared at the ceiling with a stern expression on his face. However, that passed in moments. "I understand," the guildmaster said to Ainz. "I can't refuse Momon-kun's request. Then, can you tell me this friend's name?" "She is Enri of Carne Village- no, her name is Enri Emmot." "Enri, is it? Well then, please wait for me." After a while, the guildmaster returned to the room, followed by a female receptionist he had seen before. Her body was stiff, as though it was made of ice, and she entered the room in an unnatural way. "Please excuse the disturbance, Momon-sama!" This was the first time Ainz had seen someone move so awkwardly, raising their right arm with their right leg. Although he was thinking "Wow, that's... sad" or "You don't need to be so stiff, do you?" he maintained his resolute attitude and nodded sagely. The need to maintain one's dignity was the burden of those with an adamantite rank. "She attended to the request from Enri Emmot of Carne Village. It would be better if you asked her directly. Please, ask anything of her that you need."
