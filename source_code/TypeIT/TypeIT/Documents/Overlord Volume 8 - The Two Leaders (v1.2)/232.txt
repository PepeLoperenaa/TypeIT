"Now then, the matter of the troll's settled, so I'll be taking off. Ah, Enfichan, Ainz-sama wants to reward you for developing the purple potion, so he invited you to his house. Hope you've prepared yourself Or should I say, any last words?" After saying that, Lupusregina left through the back door. "Thank you very much!" Lupusregina didn't stop or turn back in response to Enri's shouted thanks, only waved her hand. "...Ane-san, Ani-san, we'll take over the task of guiding the others. You two should go have some rest over there." Without waiting for a reply, the goblins started moving. Shouldn't they leave someone with us, Enri thought, but she was more worried for Nfirea than that, and put a hand on his shoulder. After leaving the corpse of the troll behind, the two of them sat down. "Haaaa." Their sighs of relief overlapped each other. Then, the two of them raised their eyes to look at the night sky. "She saved you."
