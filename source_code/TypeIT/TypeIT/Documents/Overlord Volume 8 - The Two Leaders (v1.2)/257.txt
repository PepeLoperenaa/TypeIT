Ainz stood up, and the sparkly-eyed Nemu stood up too. Enri's face had turned slightly hot from being referred to as a family, but she noticed something odd about Nfirea, who was rising slowly. His mouth was flattened into a straight line, with no intention of opening it. However, Enri knew the secret to loosening him up. That was to stare at him. Through the gap in his hair, Nfirea's eyes flickered back and forth, until at last, as though giving up, he sighed. "I was thinking that I can't beat him. No, I know I can't beat him. He's far better than me as a man." "But you do know that I like Enfi just the way he is, right?" Was the difference in their levels as men such an important thing? As a woman, she could not understand how significant it was. Nfirea's face turned bright red, then he took Enri's hand. "Let's go." There was no longer any darkness in those words. Although she didn't know why her lover's feelings had changed, cheering up should mean that he was happy. Hand in hand, Enri and Nfirea chased after Ainz and Nemu.
