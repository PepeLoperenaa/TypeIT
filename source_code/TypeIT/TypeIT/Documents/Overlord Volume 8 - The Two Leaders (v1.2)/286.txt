"...Perhaps you put on a bit of weight, Albedo?" It was not intended to start a fight. To a bystander, it looked like the most likely reason. "That's rude! Considering all the muscle, I'm in the ideal weight range!" "Maybe its muscles atrophied because you didn't ride it for such a long time?" "What? How's that... Since it's a summoned mount, shouldn't it be the same as summoned monsters? There's no way that would happen." "How about I try to ride it?" "Regrettably, no. This is my mount. Others can't ride it. If you try to do it by force, it unsummons." "How about just asking the bicorn directly? Eh, bicorn, what's the matter?" Aura asked. It was not because Aura could communicate with horses, but because bicorns were relatively intelligent enough for her to try. However, bicorns could not speak and made only horse-like sound. "If talking is too much... Can't it write?" The bicorn neighed like it agreed. The three looked at each other.
