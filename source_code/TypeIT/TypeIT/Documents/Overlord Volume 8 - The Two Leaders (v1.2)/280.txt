Nazarick and most of the floor was densely forested. It was an area befitting the word 'sea of trees'. However, the former members of Ainz Ooal Gown hadn't been satisfied, and didn't stop after simply covering the floor with greenery. A Colosseum, giant trees, overgrown ruins, a lake, poisonous pits, twisted trees, mangrove forest, bottomless swamps, and various types of woodland were added to the floor. They had even accepted new residents recently, so there was a small village as well. Amidst all the sights in this verdant expanse, there was a huge lake at the middle of the floor -though it was still smaller than the underground lake on the 4th floor- and it was surrounded by a plain rather than a forest. Compared to the entire 6th floor, the plain was as small as a cat's brow, but for them, it was large enough. The first one in the group was the guardian of the floor, Aura. The way she rode on top of her wolf with pitch black fur was gallant and could be described as nothing less than extremely skilful. That was to be expected. To patrol a floor this large -though she possessed extraordinary physical abilities and just running around the entire floor was possible- she preferred riding on the back of the beasts that she had tamed. There were two others with her. One was the overseer of the guardians, Albedo. She didn't wear her normal beautiful white dress, but was instead garbed in her black full plate armour used for combat. However, she did not carry any weapon or shield.
