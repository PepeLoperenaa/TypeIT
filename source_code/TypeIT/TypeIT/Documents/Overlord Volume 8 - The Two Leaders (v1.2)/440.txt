"Albedo is so bushy down there." The first thing he heard made Ainz frown. "-Don't put it so lewdly, Aura. Ah- Ainz-sama is probably beyond this wall. Are there any holes I can peek through?" Ainz looked closely at the wall, wondering whether someone had built any strange mechanisms into it. There was a period of time when such devices were all the rage among the guild members, and some of them might have been installed here. "-Shouldn't it be the opposite? Boys should be the ones doing that." "-That is impossible. Ainz-sama just needs to command me to 'show me the goods', he doesn't need to peek." "-Oh, Shalltear is actually making sense." "-How rude. Is that a toothbrush? Brushing your teeth in the pool... Could you not do that right now?" "-It can't be helped. It is hard for me to clean myself, so I have to do it in a large bath like this." Albedo's voice seemed to be coming from a higher spot, and a loud brushing sound could be heard. "-Hmm, that looks tedious. Alright, I will allow it." "-Thank you."
