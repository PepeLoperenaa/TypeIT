Ainz lifted up Mare as if letting him ride on the shoulders. "I don't even want to hand you over to Bukubukuchagama-san." "I am honoured, Ainz-sama." Sixth, who thanked Ainz on Mare's behalf, had tears of joy flowing down her face. "On behalf of Nazarick, I thank you for remaining here with us, out of all the Supreme Beings. I know that there are many instances where we have displeased you and you have found us lacking. I know it is rude to ask this of the creator, but please allow us to serve you loyally!" "I will allow this. I said something like this to Albedo and Demiurge in the past -- I am the master of the Great Tomb of Nazarick and your liege, Ainz Ooal Gown." Ainz was surprised that he was so comfortable saying these things that he had not prepared for. Though in a way, it was not that surprising, because all he had done was vocalize how he truly felt. Mare hugged Ainz and buried his face in Ainz's shoulder. A calm voice in Ainz's mind said that it was a good thing he was not in his usual attire. A warm, wet sensation came from the shoulder of his robes, but Ainz let Mare cry. After the sniffling noise died down a little, he lowered Mare to the ground while softly petting him on the head. Ainz took out a handkerchief from his pocket to clean Mare's face. Since he had never done this for someone else before, he ended up being a bit rougher than he expected, but Mare stood still and let Ainz do as he pleased. "Then, go wash your face, Mare."
