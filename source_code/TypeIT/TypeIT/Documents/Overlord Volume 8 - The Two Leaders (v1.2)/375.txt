But the receptionist had treated Enri coldly and kicked her out due to monetary issues. They were arguing over who was responsible for slamming the door on an adamantite-ranked adventurer's friend. But... wouldn't that be the right thing to do, according to the guild rules? Ainz turned a disapproving eye to the guildmaster, who was chastising the receptionist. It's the duty of a superior to protect their subordinates when they make mistakes. Or perhaps he's putting on a big show of scolding her in front of a customer to win sympathy for her? What a masterful technique... looks like he's really getting into it. To Ainz, the receptionist had done the right thing. The guildmaster probably thought so, too. However, be it Ainz's entry through the back door or his audience with the guildmaster, it would all be forgiven because he was an adamantite-ranked adventurer. It was because adamantite-ranked adventurers were worth keeping around. "But I really didn't know!" With the receptionist almost in tears, Ainz cut in with gentle words. "You were not wrong." The receptionist's eyes went wide in surprise, and the accumulated tears finally fell. "It's very important to obey the organization's rules. While there are times when they should be bent, I won't hold this incident against you."
