The sous-chef picked up one of the mandrakes lined up in formation and stared at it. The mandrake was squirming about, as if being held by the stem on top of its head hurt. "Long live Ainz Ooal Gown! Long live Ainz Ooal Gown!" The mandrakes broke their formation and surrounded the sous-chef as if they were protesting the violence inflicted against their comrade. However, they only repeated the same phrase. "I apologize, Aura-sama. Could you make them return?" "Okay! Good! Go back!" Along with the mandrake that the sous-chef gently lowered to the ground, all the mandrakes went back inside their holes. The way they burrowed underground again reminded everyone of animals getting ready for hibernation. "I see. So it's basically like an animal's cry." "That's correct. They can only parrot certain words and can't speak in any meaningful way. They also seem to have a minimum intelligence threshold and can't speak if they have not passed that threshold. The details are under research right now." The sous-chef also added - "I'm just repeating what Demiurge-sama said." "Hmm, Albedo, will it be fine for me to ask you a question? Isn't it a problem that you, as the Overseer, do not know about the newcomers? What would you have done if there were spies?"
