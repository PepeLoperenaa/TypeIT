"Really, Enfi-kun! Say, how about this, Nee-san. Enfi-kun stinks!" "Nemu-chan! That's the smell of herbs! When you grind them up, didn't you say your hands stank as well?" "That colorful stuff is from herbs?" "...No, it's different. That's from making alchemical items, so please don't say I stink..." "But you do stink!" Nfirea's face froze. "Mm, It's all over Enfi's clothes. So maybe he should take them off when he's not working?" Enri frantically tried to explain her little sister's actual meaning, and Nfirea's face softened as he heard it. "I don't have any other clothes, though... in E-Rantel I pretty much wore those all the time." "Then, what if I made a set for you afterwards?" "Eh? You can do that?"
