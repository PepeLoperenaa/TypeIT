"Yup. Although, I think as long as you're the one doing it, it'll be fine. And, about tomorrow..." According to the plan, Enri and Nfirea would be setting out to E-Rantel, with several goblins as guards. "I'm sorry. I still need to help treat the survivors from Agu's tribe, so I can't go." After all, they would be living in the same village as the same ogres who wanted to eat them. The mental trauma had to be treated along with their physical wounds, and Lizzie's personality would only frighten them and have the opposite effect. In the end, there was nobody better for this than Nfirea. "Really? I don't feel so good about this..." Enri didn't have any experience with visiting a big city like E-Rantel, so from her point of view the burden seemed quite weighty. "Then, how about getting the village chief to go with you?" "I think that could be difficult..." The chief would be busy whipping the village into shape, and helping out the newcomers to the village, so he wouldn't be able to travel abroad. "...How about the chief's wife?" "Mm. Well, frankly speaking, there's not enough hands in the village. It used to be that way and now it's even more so."
