over his chest was the conclusive proof of his identity. A living legend, a man who made the impossible possible, the ultimate warrior. Momon from 'Darkness'. "I-It's Momon-sama! My sincerest apologies!" "Now, what's going on here... hm? This girl is..." "Yes! Because of this girl, we spent a bit of time checking up on her. I apologize for any inconvenience we've caused Momon-sa" "Enri, is it? Enri Emmot?" The air in the room seemed to freeze over. Why would a legendary adventurer know a village girl's name? "That, you are... ah, yes. That, that time, you were the adventurer who came with Enfi. Although I don't think I spoke to you... did you learn my name from Nfirea?" Momon put his hand on his chin, as though he were thinking. Afterward, he gestured to the magic caster and they exited the blockhouse. Although the soldiers wanted to follow, they couldn't leave Enri alone. Only the magic caster, now calmed down, returned to the room.
