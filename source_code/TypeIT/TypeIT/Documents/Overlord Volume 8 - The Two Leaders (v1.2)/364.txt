"Uh, I'm sorry but who... Ah, that's right. You came to the village with Enfi. I don't remember talking with you... Did you hear my name from Enfi?" Ainz froze unintentionally. The one who met with Enri was the masked magic caster, Ainz Ooal Gown. Right now, he was the adamantite-ranked adventurer wearing pitch black armour, Momon. Damn it! I said it out loud without thinking. Crap, I need to leave here quickly. But why is she here? If she was looking for me- no, looking for Ainz Ooal Gown, is something wrong? I need to hear about the details. Considering what she had just said, it was not likely that she had discovered his true identity, but he needed to take the possibility that he had been discovered into consideration. Even if she could not tell that Ainz and Momon was the same person by comparing the voice from several months ago to what was coming out through the helmet now, there was nothing to lose by being careful. Ainz called over the magic caster with a beckoning gesture. The magic caster would know more about the situation than the soldier. He took the magic caster outside the checkpoint, far away enough so that nobody else could listen in the conversation. "So... She's a friend of a friend of mine. Can you tell me what happened?" Technically, it wasn't a lie since Nfirea was both Ainz and Momon's acquaintance. The magic caster opened his eyes wide. His expression was similar to surprise, but it was subtly different. One might compare it to a strand of string connecting to another. It was like he had solved a puzzle.
