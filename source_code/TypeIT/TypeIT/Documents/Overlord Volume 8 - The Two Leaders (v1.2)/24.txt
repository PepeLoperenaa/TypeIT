san agreed to help you out. I hope you get yourself together and do your part, Ani-san." "Mmm..." "If you're just waiting for her to say "I like you" first, then more likely than not, someone else is going to snatch her away! You've got to work up the courage to tell her how you really feel." That line pierced Nfirea's heart like a dagger between the ribs. "Still, despite everything I said, looks like you've been doing pretty well on that front yourself, Ani-san. Used to be you couldn't even say a word in front of her. Now you can carry on a normal conversation, right?" "That was because I didn't have much chance to talk with Enri unless I came around to gather herbs... Now that I've moved into the village, I'm around her a lot more." "That's it, that's the spirit. All that's left is to gather your courage and step up to the plate. Maybe you should show off your strength first. According to the villagers, strong men are still the most popular. Well, for the forty-nine year old women in the village, anyways." "I'm not too confident in my arm strength. Maybe I should do more farm work or something?" "Nah, what you should be using is this, Ani-san," Kaijali spoke while gently knocking on his head. "Settle things with this. And then work your magic. If me or one of the lads think what you said was good, we'll pose like this. That's when you're going to say or do something that'll make her fall for you instantly."
