With hands clasped over her lurching heart, Sixth turned to face the source of the voice. There hadn't been anyone there, but in the moment when everyone had been distracted by CZ and looked away, Lupusregina had appeared out of nowhere. She sat on a chair with her legs crossed and even had her food placed on the table. "Aw, don't scare us like that, come on" Foire was still clinging tightly to Lumiere, her eyebrows pressed into a / \ shape. "My heart almost jumped out of my mouth" Lumiere murmured like she was shocked out of her mind and paid barely any attention to Foire clinging to her. Lupusregina -the friendliest of the battle maids- was unpredictable. Still, given that she spent her time moving between the different maid groups, being approached by her was a sign of good fortune. The proof was evident from the envious looks of some of the other maids, who had noticed Sixth and her situation. "Ah, sorry, seems the experiment in the village was effective, you three made some pretty nice reactions" The way Lupusregina supported her face with her arm on the table, while having an evil grin on her face, made her look a little like a cat out of the storybooks. Although her smile was nothing but mischievous, it was still surprisingly attractive. The battle maid's smile made Sixth's head go blank for a moment. The other two seemed to feel the same way, but the first to recover was Fiore.
