Although Enri was shouting at this point, her voice still couldn't carry over the racket the goblins were generating. Spoons and plates were flying, while shouts and angry roars rose and fell like waves in a storm-tossed bay. Of course, everything being thrown was empty, because none of the goblins would even dream of wasting the food Enri made for them. Still, it was utterly inexcusable. Steeling herself, Enri furrowed her brows and took a deep breath. "Don't wolves eat meat? Just because you're higher level than me, don't go thinking I can't whup you fist to fist!" "Fist to fist, you say? Since you're so hungry, how about a knuckle sandwich?" And just as Enri stood up, everyone immediately returned to their seats and calmly resumed their meal as though nothing was wrong. "ALL OF YOU, QUIT MAKING A RACKET!" Enri's furious bellow echoed across the silent air above the breakfast table. "Ah..." Surprised, Enri looked all around, but the only thing she could see were the goblins looking at her with expressions on their faces which said, "We were all quietly having breakfast, is that a problem", or "being suddenly shouted at for no reason at is really vexing". After standing silently for a while, she plopped back into her seat, red-faced. "Pfhahahahaha!"
