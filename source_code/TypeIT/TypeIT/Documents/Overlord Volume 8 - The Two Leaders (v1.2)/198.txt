Enri said so unhappily, which drew grim smiles from the villagers. "...But don't tell Gown-sama I said that, okay?" That follow-up turned those smiles into laughs. That should break the tension, Enri thought. Although it would be bad if they were too relaxed, being too tense would also keep them from fighting effectively. Now, the mood seemed about right. Jugem looked thankfully at Enri. It seemed like he understood why she'd said what she'd said. "Don't worry. Just stay behind and shoot. We'll handle the front." The goblins had trained the defense force for precisely this role, which suited them best. A small village would be hard-pressed to gather armor and weapons, and there simply weren't enough to arm the defense force. And in the end, they were still villagers. They might have strong arms from working the fields, but that didn't translate into sword skills. Anyone who could train himself into a warrior that could defeat monsters in their free time between chores would be nothing short of a genius. With those points in mind, the goblins realized that they couldn't turn the defense force into frontliners. Instead, they decided to teach them archery to become the rear guard.
