"Tha-that I know." After all, he was the kind of man who would freely give out valuable and potent items such as those horns. "Which is why, please be at ease. Deliberate damage aside, Ainz-sama will smile and forgive you for any accidents. And even if anything is damaged, it can be repaired with magic." "Even if you say that, that..." "I understand. Then, please have a drink. That way, you'll be able to relax." "But..." Enri glanced at the tea service on the silver pushcart. They were made of exquisite porcelain, edged in gold, and the reverse side was a deep blue, patterned with intricate designs. And they looked fragile enough that Enri was worried that they would break the moment she touched them. "Enri, have a drink. It would be rude to refuse further." "Ah, then, that one, thank you." "Understood... hm, I see. The fragrance and taste of herbal tea is an acquired taste. Would you rather have traditional black tea instead?" "Yes, please, thank you."
