Ainz had no idea who Brita was, going by her name alone. While trying to maintain an all-knowing sage-like facade -which was to say, a carefully blank expression- he struggled frantically to think of a solution. Could it be that potion? Ainz recalled the first night he spent in E-Rantel. As the memories came to mind, Ainz was grateful that his body could no longer sweat. -What should I do? What should I say? But he could not keep silent forever. Demiurge! Albedo! Why aren't you here! No, Demiurge is currently abroad performing his tasks, and Albedo is in confinement! It's too late to call her over! "-Is that so, you really don't understand?" "Yes. I apologize for my lack of knowledge. Please enlighten me." Just don't ask! Ainz wanted to shout. However, he had no other options, so all he could do was roll the dice and hope for the best. As the thought came to mind, courage filled him. "Fufu... hahahaha. Indeed, it was a dangerous move that you, Lupusregina, have the right to be curious about. It could have resulted in a development that we would not be able to control. However, there was a motive for taking such risks." "A-a motive? Wasn't it just meant to compensate her for the loss of her potion?"
