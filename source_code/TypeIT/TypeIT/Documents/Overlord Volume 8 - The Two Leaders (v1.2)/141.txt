"Let her go. That great man, Momon the Black, has vouched for her with his status as an adamantite-ranked adventurer. I think there's no point in keeping her here. What do you think?" "That's an obvious decision... but, is it really all right?" "Is it really all right to doubt him, of all people?" "O-Of course not! I get it. We'll grant her passage. Enri Emmot of Carne Village, you are allowed to enter the city. You may go." "Ah, yes. Thank you very much." After bowing quickly to them, Enri left the blockhouse. As her back receded into the distance, the soldier turned to the magic caster. "What about Momon-sama?" "He left first." "Then... what connection would that hero have with that village girl?" "Hell if I know. Momon-dono told me what I told you, he vouched for her and asked that we let her go."
