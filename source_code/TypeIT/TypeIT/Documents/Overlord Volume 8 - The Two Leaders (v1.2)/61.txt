"Thanks, Enri." "No problem, Enfi. Although, now that I think of it, all this specialist equipment is amazing. You need so many things..." Out of the corner of her eyes, Enri could see the goblins nodding in a wordless "very good, very good" manner. Although she was surprised by why they were so happy, she eventually decided that her first priority was getting the job done. "Then, let's start the search!" With a throttled "Oh!" to keep the noise down, they began. The goblins watched the perimeter, while Enri and Nfirea began gathering the herbs. Although Enri had been prepared for the work to be difficult, they were fortunate and soon found growths of Enkaishi. The dense sheets grew thickly in the cracks of tree trunks. "It's over there. We found where they grew right away. As I thought, it's best when I'm with Enfi." "No, it's nothing like that. We're lucky we found it in a deserted area. If there were monster tracks, it would be pretty nasty." To the two humans, the large quantity of herbs, while not exactly a treasure in its own right, was akin to a small mountain of coins. Enri desperately fought the desire burning in her heart. This place was dangerous, it was better that she put her greed aside and worked to steadily complete the job. However, Enri knelt down, and began to pluck, minding the roots of the herbs.
