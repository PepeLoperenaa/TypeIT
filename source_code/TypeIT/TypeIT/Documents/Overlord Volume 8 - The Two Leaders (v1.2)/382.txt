Narberal's question made Ainz frown. "That is a foolish question. Narberal. Indeed, the work would proceed more quickly, but it would be very dangerous. Knowledge is power, and freely distributing it is a foolish action." Yggdrasil was also like that, so Ainz could confidently say that. "For example, there is a possibility that his potion could be refined to the point where it could kill me with a single attack. Then, it would be safer to monopolize this knowledge than to spread it... It's better for vassals to be a little ignorant, but technological advancements must be scrutinized. This is the same for Nfirea and his potions. Though I would like to lock him up in Nazarick and make him focus solely on research and development..." This would both prevent the spread of the technique and the usage of the potion. "Then, then why have you not done so?" Narberal's eyes seemed to say, "Please order me to do so," and so Ainz replied immediately, "Rather than imprison him and force him to work, I will build his trust in us as a long-term scheme that will bring better benefits to Nazarick. Demiurge analyzed the situation and concluded that it was better to shackle him to us with a debt of obligation- Hm? What's wrong, Lupusregina?" "There's one thing I don't understand. Could you explain it to a fool like me? Why did Ainz-sama give the potion to someone like Brita?"
