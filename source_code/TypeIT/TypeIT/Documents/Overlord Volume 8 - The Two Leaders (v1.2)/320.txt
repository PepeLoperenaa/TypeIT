Mare arrived at his destination in silence. In front of him was a gigantic white sphere that resembled an upside down wasp's nest. Surrounding the structure were six towering crystals, their sharp edges pointed to the sky. There were human-like silhouettes visible on the inside. As Mare stepped forward, an unnerving cracking sound came from below his feet. When he turned his attention to the floor, he could see that he was standing on a sheet of smooth ice, unlike the snow-covered plain he had been walking on thus far. The ice looked thick, but he could tell there were dark shadows lurking just under the ice. Mare kept on walking. He took each step with confidence, as if he knew the ice would not break. Despite the cracking and crunching noise, Mare arrived before the gigantic sphere without a problem. "E-excuse me. Uh, is Cocytus-san here?" Mare spoke towards one of the gigantic crystals instead of the sphere. In response, monsters with the appearance of a female human phased through the crystal. The number of monsters corresponded to the number of crystals and they wore pure white clothes. Their skin was bluish-white and their hair were black. They were "Frost Virgins" , a level 82 ice-type monster, that served as sentries for Cocytus' residence "Snowball Earth", as well as his bodyguards. "Welcome, Mare-sama. Well met." "Uh, what about, uh, Coctyus-san?"
