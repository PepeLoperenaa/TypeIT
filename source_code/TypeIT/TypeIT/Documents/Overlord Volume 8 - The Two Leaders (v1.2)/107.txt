"And I have to say this up front. Although it should be blindingly obvious, if you do anything to the people in the village... let's be honest here, you won't just get away with a scolding, you'd better be prepared to die." "I, I got it. So that's like with a defeated tribe, right? I promise that I will not harm anyone from Carne Tribe." "All right, that's good... stay away from Lupusregina, okay?" Agu understood the mix of caution and dread in the adult goblin's heart, and he engraved the warning into his heart. With that done, he realised he hadn't gotten an answer to his first question, and he asked again. "Why is Enri-san so great?" Agu had learned to behave. Or rather, it was easy for him to learn, since he was the smartest in the tribe and couldn't talk much with other goblins. "Ha. ...Enri... honestly speaking, she's very strong." "Eh?!" "It's because you're too weak that you can't tell. if Ane-san got serious, she could take care of a barghest or whatnot with just one hand, and squeeze the blood out into a cup to drink. You know?" "Really?!" "Oh yes, yes, of course it's true."
