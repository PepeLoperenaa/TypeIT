"Is that so... I'm glad you weren't attacked by monsters. Still, I can't approve of that sort of thing. The goblins are strong. but there's still monsters stronger than them. Granted, I haven't seen any of those near the plains..." "Nee-san, don't do dangerous things!" Nemu said this while clinging tightly to Enri's clothes. Enri was the only family for her little sister. Her life was no longer solely hers. It seemed like Enri had forgotten that little detail. "You're right. I'm sorry." Enri smiled and gently ruffled Nemu's hair. "Mm! Then I'll forgive Nee-san!" Nemu looked up and smiled. "Thank you. Speaking of which, has Nemu been a good girl? You didn't bother Enfi, did you?" "I didn't! Really I'm not a little girl anymore! Right, Enfi-kun?" "Ahaha... well, I've been treating Agu's tribespeople, so I didn't look too closely, but I trust Nemu's behaved herself."
