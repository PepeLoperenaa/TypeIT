"I'm sorry. I haven't heard anything concerning this Giant of the East. And I don't think Master Latimon knows either. We've never ventured into the depths of the Forest and don't know much about its residents." "Then, Agu, tell us the basics about him." "When you say the basics, you mean..." Enri understood Agu's confusion. In situations like these, it was better to ask questions one by one, so it would be easier for him to answer. "Then, can you tell us about the powerful monsters in the Forest?" "Well, to me the barghests and the ogres are all strong... but if you want to talk about things on the level of the Giant of the East, then in the forest, there are the powerful ones called the Three Monsters. The first is the Beast of the South. They say he's an incredible guy who will slaughter everyone who sets foot in his domain. I don't know what happened to him. Then there's the Giant of the East. His base is in the withered forest. Finally is the Serpent of the West. I heard it's a disgusting snake that can use magic." "Strange... how about the north?" "There seems to be a lake in the north with all kinds of races. As for who rules them... I don't know. But there seem to be twin witches in the swamp. And when the Beast of the South vanished, the forest became weird. I'm not too sure what exactly happened, apparently some really scary guy showed up, and then the balance of power shifted..." "Is that the Monument of Destruction?"
