If I thank him the next time we meet... will he forgive me? Although she was thinking that she should immediately start searching for him once she had the time, there were reasons why she couldn't. Those reasons were what she was currently worried about. She clutched a portion of her clothes, feeling for the horn inside it to banish her uneasiness. The goblin-something horn. This... this is worth several thousand gold coins? No way. Please tell me that's not true... Enri's sweat flowed like a river. The horns had been given to her so casually that she hadn't expected it to be that valuable. No, Nfirea had said it was a high-end magic item... but the amount was beyond her imagination. Is it alright for me to use this item? Will it be okay? If she was told to return the other one she had already used, what should she do? I'll need several thousand urns of herbs... I might not be able to afford it in a lifetime of picking herbs... In addition, she had another item worth thousands of gold coins. Is Gown-sama a man who can give out such items so easily?! Or maybe, he didn't know its value... no way, there's no way someone like him wouldn't know... but, if he didn't know... Enri's stomach grumbled and ached.
