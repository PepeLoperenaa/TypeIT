"-Eh?" Lupusregina smirked as she patted Enri's shoulder. "Personally, I think you'd make a great chief. Also... why don't you ask that boy?" After taking her hand off Enri's shoulder, Lupusregina twirled in place. It was a movement that seemed estranged from any concept of the word "friction". "Seeya then." Lupusregina strode off, her hands flying freely through the air. In front of her stood Nfirea with Nemu's hand in his. Lupusregina patted Nfirea on the shoulder, and as though she had flipped a switch, the two came to life. "Welcome back, onee-san!" Nemu must have been very worried, because she tackle hugged Enri while running at full speed. Enri was hit hard enough that she thought she might be knocked down, but her sturdy leg muscles absorbed the impact. "Welcome back, Enri. You're earlier than expected. Didn't spend the night?" "I'm home. And yes, I camped out last night."
