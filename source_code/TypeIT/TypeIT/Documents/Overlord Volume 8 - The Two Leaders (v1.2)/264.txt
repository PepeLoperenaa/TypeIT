Yeah... A slime bath is good, but sometimes I should take a regular bath as well. Nazarick's 9th floor had various facilities. One of them was the grand bathhouse. It was a facility modelled after a spa resort and served as a multi-purpose bathing facility with a variety of tubs and baths. "Should I go...?" But going there alone was no fun. Then- "Yes! I should take the guardians with me. It'd be good if everybody had some free time." Ainz smiled brightly at his own brilliant idea. Nazarick Time 7:14 There were two types of maids in Nazarick. One group was the combat maids, who were represented by Yuri Alpha, and the other was the regular maids who had no combat abilities. The latter were homunculi, with a combined racial and job level of 1, and they were responsible for various jobs in the tenth and ninth floor of Nazarick. In particular, cleaning the various Supreme Beings' rooms was a task of utmost importance to them. Within that group of maids, there was one maid called Sixth who kept her composure while rushing forward. This skill was a common technique amongst the maids, nothing special. She hurried towards the staff canteen.
