In an instant, amidst a shower of pink petals, there was a vision of a woman in clothes which were red on top and white below "Welcome" A harmonious chorus of voices greeted them. Looking around, they had arrived in an even more luxurious hallway, with two rows of astoundingly beautiful maids flanking them on both sides. At the end of a passage stood a man in a black robe that seemed to suck in all light from around him, wearing a bizarre mask. He was the savior of the village, Ainz Ooal Gown. A panicked Enri froze where she stood. The chandeliers on the ceiling sparkled, and the white marble floor was spotless. A magnificent passage and pretty maids all in two rows. It was like walking into a fantasy world. Lost in this ephemeral, dream-like world, Enri accidentally lost her grip on Nemu's hand. The part of her mind that wasn't completely overwhelmed by her surrounding recognized this, and in the next moment, Enri snapped back to reality. Nemu ran ahead.
