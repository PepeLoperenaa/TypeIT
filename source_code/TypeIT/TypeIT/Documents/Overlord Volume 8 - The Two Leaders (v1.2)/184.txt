Enri looked incredulously at Nfirea. Was he lying? But there wasn't even a shred of deception in the air around him. "The most important thing to them isn't the village, it's you. But if you become the chief, then the village becomes your property, and the goblins will stay and fight for the village to the bitter end. It may not seem like a big difference, but it is a difference. As an aside, they've told me that if an emergency like that happens, they're hoping I can take Nemu and flee behind you. Enri... if you want to check with them it's fine. But I hope that if you do, you'll keep the fact that I told you about it a secret." "I won't ask them." Nfirea lifted his hair up as he heard the straight, direct reply, revealing his wide eyes. "Is that okay? I might be ly-" "-That's not possible. Nfirea wouldn't lie to me. I trust you. However, is the master really that important to her summons?" "Well, wouldn't that be because you're their master? You bought weapons for the goblins, right? Don't you think they'd make you their top priority because of that? It may sound bad, but the goblins have never gotten anything from the villagers, who treat them as nothing more than your summoned monsters. Who do you think they'd prioritize, the people who barely acknowledge them, or the person who feeds them and arms them?"
