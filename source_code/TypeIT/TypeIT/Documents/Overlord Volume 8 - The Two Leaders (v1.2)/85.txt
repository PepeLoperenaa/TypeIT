What they saw was a stunning beauty. She was a woman with twin braids and brown skin. She was dressed in what she called her maid wear, and she carried a strange-looking weapon on her back. She was a suspicious-looking individual, and at the same time a familiar one. Lupusregina Beta. She was a maid serving under Ainz Ooal Gown, the savior of Carne Village, and she had been responsible for delivering the alchemical items and apparatuses to the Bareares as well as commanding the stone golems. Her cheerful and carefree attitude made her very popular with the villagers. However, she had a habit of appearing out of nowhere like she had just now. The villagers believed that it was only natural that a maid in service to a great magic caster should know magic of her own, and Enri had shared that opinion too. Even so, appearing like that all of a sudden was still frightening. "Lupu-san, w-where did you...?" "Really now, En-chan, I've been following behind you guys from the beginningsu. Strange, didn't you guys notice? I thought everyone was ignoring me because I had no presencesu" "Eh? Ehhhh?" Although she sounded like she was kidding, her tone was very serious. Enri looked around for help from the others. "Then  Lupu-nee, could you stop playing around?"
