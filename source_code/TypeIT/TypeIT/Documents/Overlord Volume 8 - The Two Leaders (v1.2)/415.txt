"That is splendid. Can it replace the Giant of the East? No, that would... be difficult. Alright, bring your minions to my- no, to the building this child is constructing. Aura, let him go." "Would it be fine?" "It's fine, he already swore fealty to me. If he betrays me, I will think of another way." Aura slowly removed her hand from the naga's throat, which had bruises in the shape of a hand. It was still tense, but the naga relaxed a little. Ainz ignored him and walked towards Guu's carcass. "I will use this as a reference for zombie trolls." Using a special skill. Ainz could turn corpses into undead. They were either zombies or skeletons, but the stronger the physical body, the more powerful the zombie. One famous example would be zombie dragons. Ainz picked up the sword, which was much taller than himself, from the ground. It was a magic item that could change its size according to one's strength. It would fall out of his hand if he tried to wield the sword as a weapon he was unable to equip, but just holding it was fine. "How about giving this to the village to make it stronger? That might be the best way to use this magic item. It is not valuable enough to bring it back to Nazarick." "Ainz Ooal Gown-sama!" Ainz looked boredly at the Naga who was trying to say something.
