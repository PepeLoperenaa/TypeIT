As she stopped the wagon at the meeting point, the goblins within, having heard the wagon, streamed out to greet her. "Oh! Welcome back, Ane-san. I'm glad nothing happened." Enri smiled. Their welcome was what made Enri feel that she had really returned to the village, because to her, the goblins were part of her family. "I'm home!" "That's a lot of stuff. Are you bringing it inside?" "That's right, bro. Do me a favor and lend me a hand." "Coming!" The goblins moved as one, deftly unloading the cargo. Some went here, some went there, and eventually all the items were packed away without the need for Enri to direct them. This was the proof of how much the goblins had integrated themselves into village life. "Ah, Ane-san, let us handle the rest. Why don't you go meet your sister and Ani-san? Although I don't know if Ani-san's still helping with Agu's people." "Thank you, but I still need to report to the chief first."
