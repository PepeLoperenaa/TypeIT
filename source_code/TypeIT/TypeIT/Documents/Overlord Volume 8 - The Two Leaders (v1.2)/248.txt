The maid's face displayed stunned confusion for a moment as she parsed Enri's lightning-fast answer. Then she turned her gaze to Nfirea, and then back to Enri. "...Ah, will this be all right?" "Ah, yes." Perhaps she sensed how Enri was so tense that her body had frozen up, or Nfirea's innate nervousness, but the maid smiled, genuine and unforced. She said a simple "My apologies", and sat herself down beside Enri. Then she gently placed a hand on the petrified Enri's shoulder. "Emmot-sama, please do not be so tense. Emmot-sama and Bareare-sama are guests, all you need to do is be at ease and relax." "But, but... w-what if we break something in here..." "Do not worry. Ainz-sama will not be bothered even if the objects in here are damaged." "But, but how? All the things in here are..." Even thinking about the cost of the things she could see in a quick glance around the room made her head hurt. And to think, these items weren't a big deal? "Yes, Ainz-sama is extremely wealthy."
