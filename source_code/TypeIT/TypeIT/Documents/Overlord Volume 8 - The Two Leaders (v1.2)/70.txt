Although it couldn't speak, its actions made its intentions clear. Make a move and I kill the brat. However "Very good! Go ahead and kill him!" The three goblins ignored the barghest's taunt, and stepped in with growls of their own. This unexpected response brought confusion to the eyes of the barghest. The barghest could not have known that the goblins had not shown up with the intention of saving the goblin child. They were only here because of Enri's wish, and their attitude was "as long as we tried to save him, it's good enough". Since they had shown themselves for a confrontation, if they didn't kill the barghest their precious Enri might get hurt. Because of that, they needed to finish off the barghest for good. So if the goblin child was murdered, if that wasted their opponent's first action and let them seize the initiative, then the goblins would gladly let the kid die. Seeing itself reflected in the blades of three machetes, the barghest understood that it could not use its hostage against them and stopped moving. It was confused as to whether or not it should kill the boy it was pinning down. Taking his life would be easy. It would be gone in one bite. However, if it did that, there was no question that it would be hacked to pieces by its enemies' weapons. The threat to its life led the barghest to its decision.
