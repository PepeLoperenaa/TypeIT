"...However, if the enemy can easily take out a forest tribe, that means they must have gathered a lot of fighting power." "Wrong! ...Originally, our tribe was a lot stronger. However, when we went in search of new places to live, our tribe dispatched mixed teams of ogres and adult goblins. If they're still alive, we can still fight back!" "Then those adult goblins still haven't come back yet?" As Brita spoke, Nfirea tilted his head, as though thinking about something. "About that... although this is a completely different topic, could I ask you about something that's bothering me? Do you speak the same way that other goblins do?" "What do you mean?" "Ah, you don't know? In the past, I've met goblins myself, and don't take it the wrong way, but they spoke like morons. In the village though, Jugemsan and the others speak normally. The same goes for you - as in you both speak fluently. Because of that, I was wondering if the ones I saw were savage goblin tribes or something." "No, it's just that I'm particularly smart for a goblin. Most goblins speak in single syllables. That made conversation in the tribe really troublesome, I can tell you that. I was seriously wondering if I was from another tribe instead. Now, just to be safe, let me ask you this, was I born in a tribe from around here? Have you heard anything about me?" "No, we don't know... You kid...Could it be... Ane-san, Ani-san, could you come over here for a bit?" Nfirea and Enri followed Kaijali to the corner of the room.
