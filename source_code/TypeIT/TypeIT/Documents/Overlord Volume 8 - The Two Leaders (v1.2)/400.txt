"Anyhow come-" The ogres raised their clubs high and swung down "in house-" as they attempted to send Ainz and Aura flying. However, their non-enchanted clubs would never be able harm them. "Say sorry-" The ogres struck again. Ainz head was clobbered hard and his vision shook a little. It didn't hurt, but it still made him mad. Anyway, Ainz would kill anyone invading Nazarick in a fit of rage. When he thought about it that way, it was only natural that they would attack him, so he took it without complaint. An envoy of peace would lay down his arms and wait for the situation to unfold. The ogres arriving afterward didn't have clubs, and simply reached for Ainz and Aura with their bare hands. They probably wanted to grab him after seeing that clubs were useless. Ainz furrowed his brows for a moment, although that gesture couldn't be seen since he was a skeleton. It was fine for them to grab him, but Ainz saw through the darkness that the hands of the ogre reaching for him were covered in blood. "Filthy." Ainz immediately took a staff out of thin air and swung it. It wasn't imbued with any special magic, only an enchantment that increased the blunt damage it dealt. The head of the ogre reaching for him exploded. The ogres were splashed by the splattered brains and blood, and stepped back after dropping their clubs. "You, you no skeleton..." "It is troubling to think of me as a skeleton. I am here to meet your boss, the Giant of the East. Can you get him to come here? Well, he will probably come anyway if I wait."
