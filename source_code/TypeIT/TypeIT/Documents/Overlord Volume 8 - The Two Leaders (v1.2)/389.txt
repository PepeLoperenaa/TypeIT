Back to the previous topic; let me know what you've found." "Yes. Er, I'm very sorry, but I haven't heard anything about the Giant of the East and the Serpent of the West. After we fought that tree monster called Zy'tl Q'ae, I did a quick sweep of the forest, aside from the underground caverns, which I didn't investigate. I didn't find any strong enemies..." "Well, if they're only as strong as Hamsuke, I understand why you wouldn't have paid any attention to them." Even a gardener would not know how many ants were crawling in his domain. If they occasionally missed a strong enemy, that could only be chalked up as part of the job. "I am truly sorry. Then, Ainz-sama, will we be doing house-cleaning?" "That sounds like a good idea. We'll get rid of those pesky flies and put the forest under Nazarick's complete control." "Got it! Then, I'll send some of my pets along-" "Mm, about that, it seems a little boring that way. I'd like to see what sort of creatures this Giant of the East and Serpent of the West are, who can rival Hamsuke." "Then, shall I bring them here?"
