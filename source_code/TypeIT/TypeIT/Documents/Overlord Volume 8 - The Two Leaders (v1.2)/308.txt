"They're so soft, I want one too..." "Feels good, doesn't it? But when fighting, their fur turns as sharp as needles." The level sixty-seven monster, Spear Needle. When entering combat mode, their fur turned into a thicket of thin needles. If killed in combat mode, the fur wouldn't return to its original soft state, so it was important to kill it stealthily with a single strike. That's why the players who hunted Spear Needles were much higher in level than the monsters themselves. "Is that true? Oh my, how scary." Even after saying it out loud, Shalltear kept petting it. "Well, it won't go into combat mode unless I order it to, or if enemies are nearby. But realistically, is there anyone who's really going to be an intruder here? I haven't gotten any reports from other floors either." "Of course. After all, I placed servants with excellent detection abilities on the 3rd floor. It would be hard for anyone to get through them undetected." Aura suddenly stopped moving and turned her head towards the colosseum. "What is it, Aura-sama?" "A gate from the 7th floor just activated."
