Enri was so nervous that she was about to faint. "I knew we should have gone with her." Although Ainz had refused, the idea of Nemu going by herself made her stomach boil in anxiety. "I just hope she doesn't trouble Gown-sama..." "It'll be fine, don't worry. Gown-sama is very accommodating. I think he'll overlook any minor rudeness from a young girl." "Mm, but, you see, if you anger a noble, you'll be executed..." "I've heard that too, but to be honest, I've never seen it before. E-Rantel and its surrounding territory are administered by the king himself, so I don't think the nobles would dare to make a fuss... Is Gown-sama a noble?" "Isn't he? Anyone with such a luxurious manor and so many pretty maids would have to be a noble, right? There's no way they could gather all these things otherwise." "Mmm? Is that so? To be honest, I don't think even a noble could assemble beautiful maids like these." Enri's eyebrows shot up at a dangerous angle.
