The troll smelled ogre on the cloth, and suddenly, it understood. It had mistaken this cloth that reeked of ogre-stink for an ogre itself. This was not a coincidence. "Humans!" Roaring angrily, the troll started tearing up its surroundings. No humans. Then they should still be in their homes. The troll's fist pounded angrily at a nearby house and after hammering at it several times, it reached up to tear the roof off, intent on destroying the interior. A human rushed out in a panic as it was demolishing the house. Eager to tear the human apart as well, it gave chase.    The target was chasing her. That meant the plan was working. Though she was grateful for that, her heart was still pounding and she wanted to cry. A gigantic, man-eating monster was pressing in from behind, and this highstakes game of tag - if she lost, she would disappear down that monster's throat - was something any ordinary village girl would cry about. The fact that she didn't know how long she'd have to play this game made her want to cry even more.
