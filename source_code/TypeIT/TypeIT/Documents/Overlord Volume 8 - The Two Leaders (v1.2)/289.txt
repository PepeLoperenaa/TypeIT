Aura and Albedo couldn't help stare enviously at her. "That is correct. This is the encyclopedia written by Peroroncino-sama! A reward for carrying out Ainz-sama's commands!" It was more like a participation prize than a true reward, but Shalltear still smiled because it was one of the greatest gifts she could receive. Or rather, that was how it was supposed to be. An item left behind by one's creator was more important than any reward. The dictionary named 'Encyclopedia' was given to every player at the start of the game. It was a unique item that was impossible to take by force unless the owner gave it away voluntarily. Yggdrasil was a game that emphasized the joy of learning about the unknown. This was an item that reflected the developer's intention of turning mysteries into exploration. Once a player encountered a new monster, the Encyclopedia automatically recorded its basic data. However, the detailed stats were not recorded, only the name, appearance, and if it was a mythological monster, the myth behind them. If one wanted to fully utilize the potential of this item, they needed to investigate the monster's weaknesses or special abilities themselves and manually enter them into the book. The Encyclopedia that Shalltear held was an item that Peroroncino used to own and which he wrote extensively on. Ainz had given it to Shalltear after remembering that Peroroncino left the book behind in the Treasure Room before he quit.
