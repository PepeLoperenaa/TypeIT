"My deep apologies, Mare and I thought about going earlier." "Is that so, then Cocytus- you are already holding it. Let's meet before the bath house then. Increment, if anyone comes to my office, let them wait here." "Understood." Ainz got up and left the room after hearing the answer from the maid. Leaving the minions who wanted to follow behind, Ainz led the way to the bath house that was situated in floor 9 as well. Ainz thought it would be better to chat idly as they walked side by side, but Cocytus's cautious nature didn't allow him to do so. Maybe he noticed that Ainz was feeling a bit lonely, Cocytus closed the distance and asked: "Ainz-sama. Did. The. Number. Of. Eight. Edge. Assassins. In. The. Room. Decrease? Were. They. Sent. Somewhere?" It might still be related to work, but conversing casually with Cocytus made Ainz feel better. Still, he kept his elation a secret when he spoke. "They are in the E-Rantel hotel. Narberal is staying there in case some visitors appear. The Eight Edge Assassins are conducting surveillance some distance away." "Isn't. It. Dangerous. For. Narberal. To. Be. Alone?" "It is, right now is a good chance for someone to attack." "I. See. She. Is. The. Bait. Right. Now?"
