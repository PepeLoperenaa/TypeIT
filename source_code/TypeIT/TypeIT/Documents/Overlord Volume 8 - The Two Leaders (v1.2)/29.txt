One of the goblins, Kuunel, raised up his spoon to prove his point, displaying a piece of chicken meat that onlookers might well have mistaken for a pea. It was nothing more than a tiny bit extra that Enri added while portioning out the food to everyone. "I finished my meat, yet there was more at the bottom of the soup! Do you have anything like that? I didn't think so! This is nothing less than the proof of love!" "You must be kidding me! That's nothing more than a piece of meat Ane-san mistook for a chunk of vegetable!" "Maybe that's just wishful thinking on your part? Maybe the "meat" you ate was just potatoes or something, and the actual meat you got was that miniature thing. You'd better watch out, it's proof that Ane-san doesn't like you. Plus, my god clearly told me, "You must make Enri happy." "Isn't the god you believe in an evil one, Cona?!" Half the goblins were standing, and the other half were seated and squabbling, fanning the flames of conflict. Even Nemu had somehow joined the squabbling party. Only a few people weren't participating in this battle royale. Those people had their heads lowered to the table, and the most prominent one of them was Nfirea. "...Powdered ruby... arcane feathers... ashwood pestle... mor... mortar... tar... tatas?" Nfirea was muttering to himself as he spooned the food into his mouth, but the food in the spoon hadn't even reached his mouth before it went back to the bowl. His eyes weren't visible due to his long hair, but in all likelihood he was walking on the thin line between dreams and reality. "Enfi, are you alright?"
