It felt a glimmer of pride at seeing through its opponents and slowly began moving again. It would destroy them all in a short time. Thus, the fact that its opponents had split up was a golden opportunity. All it needed to do was slay the ogres one by one. It moved slowly, taking care not to make noise, but suddenly, a small shadow dashed out of a nearby house. It wasn't a goblin, but one of its favorite prey, humans. In contrast to the troll who had been surprised into inaction, the caped human splashed something on it... "Uguooooaaaahhh!" The troll screamed from the overpowering stench. Just by smelling the odor of the green stuff, the powerful stink burrowed into its nose and sinuses. This reek was several times stronger than that of the grass-stained ogres. Even though it could regenerate, this was not a wound it could heal. It simply could not endure the smell. Its eyes watered and it took a step toward the human, but it had already run back into the house. The reason why the human had managed to get so close despite the troll's keen sense of smell was because the human's scent had been masked by the scent of the crushed grass.
