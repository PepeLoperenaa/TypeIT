"Yup, I'm going to die." Nfirea smiled bitterly as he watched the troll, who was approaching him warily. It could not regenerate damage caused by acid and fire. Because of this, the troll was especially careful around Nfirea, who could defeat its greatest ability. It was laughable that it had to act so cautiously around a foe it could finish off in one blow. "Well, that works for me. Hypnotism!" The troll's hostility seemed unchanged. It seemed to have resisted the spell. Realizing that it had been targeted by a spell, the troll charged. The gigantic body approaching him was like a scene out of a nightmare. "If it worked, I could have held on a bit longer... no such luck. Ahhh, what a shame." Nfirea seemed to have given up. This was because it was a completely unwinnable battle, which had crossed the line from bravery to recklessness. But even so He had to buy time for Enri. With that thought in mind, Nfirea leapt into action.
