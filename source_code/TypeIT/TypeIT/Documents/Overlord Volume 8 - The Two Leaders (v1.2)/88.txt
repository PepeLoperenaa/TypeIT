"Sounds like a plan, Ani-san. She's entered the forest while training to be a ranger, so it might be better if she were there to listen to the kid. ...So what should we do, Ane-san?" "Eh? Me?" Enri panicked briefly, not having expected her name to come up during the conversation. With no particular reason to oppose it, she simply nodded her head. "Mm. Well, it's not so much that it's might be better, but that I hope she hears what he has to say. See you, Enfi." With an 'Understood', Nfirea left the group behind. "Although waiting here's fine... maybe I should make drinks." "Great ideasu! I'm thirsty" "...Lupu-nee, aren't you a maid? That means you know how to make delicious drinks, right?" "Welp, I'm the maid of Ainz-sama, and the other Supreme Beings, soooo... I don't want to work for anyone else su. I just want to laze around su. Let's not talk about work and all that other stuff." "Is that so... well, that's a shame." Although Unlai and Lupusregina's conversation seemed quite normal, Enri could still feel a chill run through her.
