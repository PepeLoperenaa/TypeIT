"No, this really was given to me by Gown-sama! Please, you have to believe me!" Two of the soldiers exchanged looks. All of them, as well as their assigned magic caster, believed that Enri was a magic caster as well. However, given Enri's nervous reaction to the sudden change in the situation, they could not help but think she was a normal girl. "What, what else is there? Tell me why you think she's suspicious!" "Hnh! To begin with, this horn can summon a group of goblins - although I'm not sure how many it can call up, but it can do such a thing." The soldiers frowned. It would be troublesome if something like that was used on the streets. However, was that so bad? Certain people, such as adventurers, possessed a plethora of magic items. Just because this one could summon goblins wasn't too unusual in itself. "And this so-called village girl's testimony is riddled with inconsistencies. That item is worth several thousand gold coins; why would anyone just give it to a mere village girl?" "Several thousand?!" "Several thousand?!" This unbelievable sum drew cries of disbelief from the soldiers, and Enri herself.
