"That's a natural reaction. The goblins and I can help with the administration of the village. Even if I say that, though, it's always scary to have to make the big decisions." "What about a council formed from the villagers?" "To be frank, I'd thought of that myself. However, the bigger the problem, the more likely something will come up that will split up the group and leave them paralyzed by indecision. In the end, without one person calling the shots, we won't be able to solve problems effectively." "What if we had two systems, one for dealing with things in normal situations and the other for emergencies?" "That won't work. It won't nurture our leaders. The people will follow their leaders in emergencies and work together because they know those leaders are also capable in peacetime." The chief's will was firm and he had explained his reasons.

After Enri said this, she stood and left.
