"F-future?" "Yes, that's right. What is it? You seem worried... Something wrong?" "No no, it's nothing. Yes. Eh, so it will happen in the future?" "Ahh, yes. If there is a nation of dark elves, it will be good to visit it. You should come along then." "Huh?... Ah, okay! That kind of future! Right. Yes! Please let me go along with you. Well then- we are almost there, Ainz-sama." An unnatural light could be seen in the night air through the opening in the forest ahead. "Alright. Well then Aura, sorry, but can you post the monsters you brought along around the perimeter? I need to make some preparations." Ainz activated one of his unique skills, summon high tier undead. What appeared was a horseman with an ominous aura who was riding on a pale horse. Ainz repeated the summon several times. "Alright, four should be enough. Well then, Pale Riders, stand by in the air. Capture anyone who attempts to escape." The riders acknowledged wordlessly and rode into the air with a tug of the reigns. Their forms turned immaterial as the riders passed through the branches and flew into the sky. "Okay, the nets have been set. All that is left is to appraise them."
