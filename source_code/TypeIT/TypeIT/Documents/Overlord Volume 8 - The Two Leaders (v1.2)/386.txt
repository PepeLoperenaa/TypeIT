Ainz could sense the girls understood the point he was trying to make. I managed to connect all the points together... Just as Ainz was about to sigh in relief, a sudden, unexpected question came. "Then... I understand I'm being very rude, but could I ask one more question..." No, you may not. Stop. Please. I'm begging you. Don't ask me any more questions. Ainz was crying inside, but his face remained impassive. "What's the matter, Lupusregina? If you have any doubts, feel free to clarify them with me." "Yes." Lupusregina swallowed, and with a serious expression on her face, she asked, "Does Ainz-sama always think this far ahead when making plans?" How could that be? Most of the time, he made things up on the spot. Of course, he planned for the future, but more often than not, the results were completely different from what he intended. Of course, he could not say any of that. Ainz laughed quietly. It was a practiced laugh.
