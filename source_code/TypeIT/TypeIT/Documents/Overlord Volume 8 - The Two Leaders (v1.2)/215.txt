It frowned. Although ogres were its allies, there was a slight difference in the scent it was picking up. It was one of which he had no prior memory. And now it was coming from all around him. Of course it didn't come to this conclusion because its nose was as sensitive as a bloodhound's, but because it had remembered the unique odor of its ogre allies. As such, it didn't know how many ogres there were. And that brought up a question. There was a strange smell here as well, like the smell of crushed grass, but far stronger. Had an ogre shredded grass and smeared itself with the juices? It pondered this question and found confusion. The strong herbal odor stung its nose, and its tears were about to flow. If the ogres could endure this stench, it must have been because they had a bad sense of smell. It could take them on face to face. As a troll, it was much stronger than any ogre. However, that didn't mean it could escape unscathed, and it would take time to deal with them. Because trolls had the natural ability to regenerate, their wounds would recover over time. However, regenerating its injuries would still take a while, which was troublesome. Who knew, its fellow ogres might have eaten all the humans by the time it got there. Then, since the opposition had dispersed, as long as it moved straight ahead, they would all come out to attack it.
