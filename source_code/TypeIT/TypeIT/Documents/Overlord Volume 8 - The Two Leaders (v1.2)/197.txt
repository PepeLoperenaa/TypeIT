"That's not impossible." Jugem softly confirmed Brita's suspicions. If that was the case, it would mean Agu had drawn the monsters here. That was why Jugem had lowered his voice, so the defense force wouldn't pick up on it and direct their aggression at Agu. The existence of monsters like the Giant of the East, the Serpent of the West and their mutual enemy, the Beast of the South, had already been made known among the villagers. Although the Beast had been tamed by the Dark Hero, the mighty monster's form and presence had been etched indelibly on the villagers' hearts. Fear was the appropriate response to the thought of fighting something on the same level as that. "So what kind of magic does the Serpent of the West use? Damn, what a pain." Jugem nodded to Brita's mumbling. "Usually, monsters with innate spells won't have more than ten of them, but if they can practice and learn magic they'll have access to many more, which makes them troublesome. If they know magic for crossing obstacles..." "It's okay if it's Enfi or the goblins, but magic-users are cheating bastards."
