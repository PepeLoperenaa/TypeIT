"Oya isn't that Yuri-nee? Are you flying because of a magic item?" "That's right. Ainz-sama bestowed it upon me himself. This would be... Carne Village, right? That would be why you were scolded." "That's right. Ahhh, now the fun's about to begin" "What do you mean?" "A new leader has just arisen within the village. To the villagers, they're about to turn to a new page in their history. However, I wonder what would happen if, at this glorious moment, the village was attacked and everything set ablaze. I wonder what kind of faces those villagers would make?" A sadistic grin spread over her beautiful face, and anyone who saw her would immediately conclude that something evil and horrible had been unleashed. "And I thought you got along with these people. Is this coming from the bottom of your heart?" "That's right, Yuri-nee I mean every word of it. Every time I think of the people I get along with getting trampled like ants and exterminated with brute force, I can't help but laugh." "You're terrible. You're as bad as Solution. Why are my little sisters like this? Really, the only good one is Shizu... although I suppose Entoma isn't a bad girl."
