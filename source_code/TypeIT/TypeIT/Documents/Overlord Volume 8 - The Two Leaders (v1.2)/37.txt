The first step was to dismantle the unoccupied houses and use them to build a wall. Of course, those materials were insufficient on their own, so they would have to enter the forest to cut down trees for lumber. Since entering the forest's depths might mean encroaching on the Wise King of the Forest's territory, their harvest area had to proceed along the outskirts of the forest toward the distance. Naturally, the goblins were the ones who provided security for the woodcutting villagers. As a result of them taking on that task, the villagers' distrust of the goblins had almost completely disappeared. Part of that was because human knights, who were of the same race as themselves, had attacked them. Even if they were of the same race, they had tried to take the villagers' lives. In contrast, the goblins worked under Enri to contribute to the village, even though they were of a different species. The decision of which side to trust was no longer one which could be easily settled by deciding along racial lines. And the most important reason was that the goblins were strong. They could serve as warriors to take on the duties of sentries, and when people were hurt, the goblin priest Cona could heal them. It was difficult to despise goblins like these. In this way, the goblins managed to establish themselves in the village in just a few short days and quickly became an indispensable part of village life. This could be seen from the house the goblins lived in; no consideration had been made of the fact that they were from another race, and a large house had been built close to Enri's own home in the middle of the village. Although the villagers and the goblins had worked together on the village defense plan, there simply weren't enough hands to make the work go quickly. As such, in the beginning they had only built simple fences.
