Enri shouted out just as Jugem finished. The forcefulness of Enri's voice surprised even herself, and Agu at the edge of her vision twitched violently, but that was fine. What was important was that the ogres had lowered their heads to her. For the time being, the ogres had acknowledged Enri's superiority. "Well then, what do you have to say to our boss, the chief of Carne Village, our Ane-san?" With their heads still lowered, what emerged from the ogres was a torrent of confused voices. "So, so scary, little boss. Forgive." "Sorry, we attacked your tribe. Please forgive." By "your tribe", the ogres probably meant Agu's tribe. Though the reality was somewhat different, it was easier for them to understand the situation as Agu's people being part of Carne Tribe, in order to avoid overloading the ogres' brains. "We will, work for you." "That's right! Work for me and my tribe!" That last statement was made with the dregs of her spirit she could muster. Although she'd only said two or three sentences, Enri was already very tired. It was as bad as the encounter with the barghest.
