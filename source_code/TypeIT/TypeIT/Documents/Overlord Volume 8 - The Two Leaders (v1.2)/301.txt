"Ahhh, is that why Ainz-sama ordered so that only those who were selfsufficient be allowed in? So it would not upset the balance of the population?" "Yea... Don't you know about it?" Albedo looked at the faces of the other three, one after the other. "This is troubling. Not knowing anything about the place you're protecting is no good. Make some time for it in your schedules. I'll explain everything then." Albedo let out a sigh and looked at the field without much thought. Then she recognized the plant leaves that were spread out in front of her. "Is that a carrot... no, a magical carrot?" "No, that's not the case. Did the Overseer not receive any reports about it?" "What do you mean?" The sous-chef's gaze headed towards Aura. "Mm, nothing... I see. You weren't told of it. Then Aura-sama, what should I do? Will Aura-sama demonstrate it? I believe I taught you as well?" "I definitely put it on the report..." Aura smiled before breathing in deep and shouting with a loud voice.
