Making note of the troll's upraised left arm, he ran forward and to the left. Seeking life in death, he plunged head-first into danger to reach the safety beyond it. The troll's fist followed him, and the wind of its passing ruffled his hair. And in front of Nfirea, a mighty foot kicked out at him like a moving wall. Nfirea's vision spun wildly as he flew through the air, his body making cracking sounds like shattered tree branches. He hit the ground hard and rolled several times, like a piece of discarded rubbish. Pain coursed through Nfirea's body, which was still rolling over the ground. He was in more pain than he'd ever been in his life. "No, I somehow managed to survive. That's amazing. I'm amazing..." This was because of the effects of his defensive spell and the fact that the troll had been unable to kick with all its strength. Ignoring the pain that shot through him with every breath he took, Nfirea stood, and loosed another spell. "Acid Arrow!" The pursuing troll stopped in its tracks, wary of the pool of scorching acid at its feet. Mmm, just as planned.
