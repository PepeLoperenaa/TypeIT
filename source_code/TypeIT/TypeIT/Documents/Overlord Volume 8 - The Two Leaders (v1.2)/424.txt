Hearts seemed to pop out at the end of her words as Albedo shrieked. No, not just her, Shalltear and a tired Aura was there too. Demiurge and Mare weren't here, were they already waiting inside the changing room? "Al-Albedo, why are you here?" "Hmmm? I am here to bathe with everyone... Ainz-sama too?" "Ah, yes... That's right, what a coincidence, Albedo." "Really, what a coincidence! ...I heard that it is better to exercise and sweat a little before entering the bath. How about Ainz-sama and I exercise and sweat together?" Ainz felt a sudden chill. "Well, table tennis sounds fine..." "That's not what I meant. I was talking about something naughty." With the agile movements expected of a level 100 warrior -too quick for Ainz to dodge- Albedo closed the gap with Ainz and tried to write something on his robes. However, her finger poked through the gaps of Ainz' ribs. "Ah." "Ah." Both of them spoke at the same time.
