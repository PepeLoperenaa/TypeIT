There was no way the villagers would shun the contributions of the goblins. In Carne Village, the opinion of the goblins was so good that statements like "goblins are even better neighbors than humans" were commonly heard. "Speaking of which, are there any other goblin-sans around? I wanted to treat everyone to a meal as thanks." "The others should be patrolling the village or helping the people who just moved into the village. But since obaa-san asked, then I'll make sure to tell them." "Then I'll leave that to you, Enri-chan. When the time comes, I'll make sure everyone gets to enjoy a feast made with all my skill. In the meantime, I think I'll make lunch for Goblin-san first." "Really? Then, since I've been invited, it would be rude to refuse. Ane-san, though I'm sorry that I can't join you, I'll be having lunch at Morga-san's place." Enri nodded, and the woman headed back to the village with the goblin in tow. "If the newly-arrived people realised that you guys are not bad people, that would be great." "Well, a lot of them didn't look happy to see us. After all, in their hearts we should be the enemy." "Apart from our village, treating demihumans as the enemy is the norm, right..." "That's why we're sending so many people to help the villagers with their work. It's not easy."
