The greatest change was that the villagers could now easily enter the forest and harvest its resources. The goblins were a key factor in this; meat, which had previously been hard to obtain, could now be easily acquired, and their tables were decked with fresh fruits and vegetables. As a result, the food situation in the village had dramatically improved. In addition, since the goblins were Enri's subordinates, they delivered the lion's share of their kills to her home. In addition, one of the newest additions to the village was a ranger who had made contributions to the provisions. She was a woman who used to be an adventurer in E-Rantel. For various reasons, she moved to this village, and was learning the ways of the hunter from the ranger who was living in the village. As she had been a warrior during her adventuring days, her skills with the bow were excellent, and she could bring down even the biggest game with a few arrows. It was partly because of her efforts that the distribution of meat in the village had improved. The improved standard of living brought changes, which were reflected in the villagers' bodies. Enri curled her biceps, flexing her muscles. Her gains were quite impressive. Ah, I feel so pumped they're getting even bigger... The goblins praised Enri at every opportunity with phrases like "Ane-san's totally ripped!" "Yeah, pump it up again!" "She's too swole to control!" "The goal is six-pack!" "Nice cut!". They most likely meant well, but as a girl, it was difficult to accept such compliments.
