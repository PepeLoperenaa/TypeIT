   Nazarick Time 16:41 A worried Lupusregina entered Ainz's office. The panic and unease of being suddenly summoned was written all over her face. Inside the office was Lupusregina, the regular maid Sixth, the battle maid Narberal, Aura, who was the one most familiar with the forest, the Eight Edge Assassins on the ceiling, and the owner of the room, Ainz. By the way, Albedo was still in confinement. Lupusregina was about to prostrate before Ainz when he interrupted her. "Lupusregina, is there something you've kept from me?" After seeing the confused look on her face, he wondered if she did not know about it after all. Ainz decided to repeat what he had heard about the Giant of the East and the Serpent of the West from the Adventurer's Guild. However, as Lupusregina seemed to have known about this long before, Ainz's mood changed drastically. He exhaled long and loud. "So you were aware of this, then?" "Yes. About that-" "You fool!" Ainz's thunderous shout, filled with wrath, seemed to shake the very room. As the others recoiled like they had been physically struck, Ainz felt something suppress his emotions, but even after the peak of rage was cut off, his anger surged up again, and there was no way he could fully rein in his ire.
