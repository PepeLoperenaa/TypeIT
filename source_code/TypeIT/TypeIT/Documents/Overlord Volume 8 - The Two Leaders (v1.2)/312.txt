"That's correct. My, my, for Mare-sama to come out personally. I was really lucky. If it had been Aura-sama I would have needed to ask her to call you." "Huh? Is that so?" The memo folder was a system devised by the ruler of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, Ainz Ooal Gown, himself. It was a system that allowed floor guardians to write down non-urgent messages and communicate with each other. Nothing similar existed until now. When Mare accepted the folder, he got a strange feeling and muttered "Tthis is..." while staring at it. "H-huh? But why couldn't you give it to my sister?" Since Aura was a floor guardian as well, there was no reason why the message couldn't be delivered to her as well. She was also a hard worker, so she wouldn't just throw the folder in a corner somewhere. "I don't know the details myself. But Demiurge-sama gave me specific orders to not give it to Aura-sama and hand it directly to you." "I see... W-what about Demiurge-san?" It was a short question, but Pulcinella understood what he meant. "...I can't say I fully understand what he meant either. However, I believe the answer or the reason would lie in that folder."
