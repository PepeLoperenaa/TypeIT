"Ah, then I'll leave that to you. However, wargs and barghests are very agile, and if left alone, they'll cause a lot of damage. Target them first. Also, when their druid shows up, would you mind having the defense force go to the back line?" "I'm not opposed to that, but will you have enough people on the front without us?" "...If we're lucky, we'll be enough." "If it's like that... as I thought, I'd better tell everyone here to be ready to die. At least, if we're in the back we won't be attacked, so we can concentrate fire on the druid. You know, I've been an adventurer, but this is the first time I've seen such brave villagers... at least, I thought that much when I watched them train with bows." "In the past, the village was attacked... and we hated how useless we were." Enri, who had been silent up till now, cut in with the sentiments of every member of the defense forces. Amazingly, there was nobody here who wanted to flee. There was no way around this fight, no way they wouldn't protect their village for the loved ones hiding behind them. "Speaking of which, such a large force must have taken some time to assemble. Does this mean they've been sent by the Giant of the East or the Serpent of the West?"
