"I understand. Then, I'll head over to the chief's place. I'd better do it before I change my mind!" Enfi smiled as he heard Enri's declaration. He understood the storm of emotions behind Enri's decision. It was a stern, yet kind frame of mind. "All right! Good luck, Enri!" She nodded in reply, and then without looking back, set foot on the path to becoming the new chief.    From the sky, Lupusregina could see that almost everyone in the village was gathered in the village square. Enri was at their head, addressing them, but she couldn't hear what Enri was saying. After Enri appeared to finish, the villagers were applauding. "Ha... so it did turn out like this after all. Ahhhh, I can't take it, uhihihi." "-What's so funny?" The voice from behind made Lupusregina turn around to face it.
