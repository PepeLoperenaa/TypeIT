It was little unsightly for an adventuring comrade to show such signs of loyalty in middle of a city, but Ainz knew it was useless, so he continued. "A girl called Enri will shortly pass the gate with a cart. Go and discreetly ask her why she's in E-Rantel." Next, Ainz looked for a place to hide himself. It was to avoid further conversation with Enri. He looked around and decided that a nearby stack of wooden boxes were high enough for him to hide behind and ordered Hamsuke there. The soldiers who were working behind the boxes were surprised by Ainz and Hamsuke's sudden appearance. "Soldiers, a moment of your time, if I may? I am curious as to what's in these boxes." Ainz confirmed that he was not visible from the gate and asked the soldiers. In reality, he had no interest in the wooden boxes, but only asked because he did not want to get kicked out as a hindrance. "Ah, yes, it's an honour for Momon of Darkness to take interest. This is a vegetable named 'kinshu' from Grandel. This is-" Ainz replied with "Is that so" or "Interesting" to the soldier who explained earnestly. His replies were insincere, but the soldier ignored it and carried on. After Ainz had learned quite a lot on how to cook kinshu, Nabe appeared from behind him. "-I'm sorry to cut you off. Your explanations were very helpful, but my comrade is back, so please excuse me." Ainz announced to the soldier and trotted off on Hamsuke.
