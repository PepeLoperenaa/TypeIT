Of course, dragonhide was an extremely rare item that could not be obtained except from killing a dragon. All the members of Ainz Ooal Gown used to hunt dragons together back in the past, but that was back in the days of YGGDRASIL. Because of that, Ainz limited the usage of dragonhide until they could confirm the existence of dragons and other creatures in this world. There was bound to be a moment they would need the materials, and it was foolish to use their supplies without being able to replenish them. "No, not my dragons!" "Perish the thought. No need for such measures exists. Thine dragons were specially summoned by the wills of the Supreme Beings. T'would be unthinkable to harm such blessed beings." Titus disposed the ash, which was all that remained of the scroll, into a waste bin. As he did so, he looked at the relieved Mare. "Uh, does that mean the parchment from this world isn't suitable for making scrolls?" Mare looked at the ash. "T'would be very likely. Or not- I recant my previous statement. 'Tis difficult to tell. 'Tis not unthinkable for mine methods of artifice to be a deviance in this world. For instance, the methodology of potion manufacture diverges vastly from those methods I know to be efficacious." "T-that's a possibility? But are you sure it's the parchment's fault after just one failure?"
