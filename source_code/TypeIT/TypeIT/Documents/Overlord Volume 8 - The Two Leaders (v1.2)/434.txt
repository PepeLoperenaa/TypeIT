Huh, I should have brought my cute slime, bathing assistant Miyoshi-kun with me. He shouldn't be showing others his goo-covered appearance, but cleaning himself with a brush after so long was a great hassle. While Ainz was working hard and brushing himself, Mare pulled a stool over with one hand. A little nervous with his cheeks red from the steam, Mare smiled: "Ai-Ainz-sama! I, I will help you wash your back!" "Hoh? Oh, I see. You want to help me wash up. It is tedious, so use this brush, using a towel will be tiring." Ainz turned his back to Mare, who picked up the brush and started cleaning slowly. "You are doing great." "Thank you very much!" "You can't do it wrong though", Ainz responded to Mare's thanks. He sneaked a peek at the other two. "I will help you wash up."
