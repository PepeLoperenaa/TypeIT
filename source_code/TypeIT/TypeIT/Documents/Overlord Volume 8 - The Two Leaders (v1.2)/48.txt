Seeing the surprised expression on Enri's face, Paipo patiently explained himself. "Even the cautious ones would want to expand their territory. If that's the case, then for a while, their territory is going to overlap with the others, and that's going to cause all sorts of havoc. Simply put, the chances of meeting a monster's going to increase, and so will the danger. And if you're unlucky, you might even run into something outside the forest. Ane-san's fearless and cool, but there's no need for you to personally walk into danger." "Is that so..." Although she wasn't quite sure about the fearless and cool part, that was probably the goblins way of talking her up among themselves, Enri thought. "There was also that big movement earlier. What happened there?" "I don't know. Originally, we should have sent someone familiar with the Great Forest's conditions to investigate. ...but if we go, the village's defenses will be weakened.... ah, got it! Why not hire adventurers to check it out?" "That could be difficult," Enri said, knitting her eyebrows. "According to Enfi, the cost of hiring an adventuring party is very high. Although the lords of E-Rantel will subsidize some of those costs, it'll be very hard for a village like us to pay for adventurers out of our own pocket." "I see..." "Collecting lots of herbs and selling them afterwards should help with one part of that problem... otherwise, all we can do is sell off the items we got from Gown-sama."
