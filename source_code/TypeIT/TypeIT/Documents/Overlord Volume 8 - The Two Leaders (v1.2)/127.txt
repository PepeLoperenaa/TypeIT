Someone who could notice the minute changes in the air couldn't possibly be normal. The guards brought her into the checkpoint with that in mind. "Then, could you sit down there?" "Yes." The girl sat in one of the chairs provided in the small blockhouse. "Let's start with your name and origin." "Yes. My name is Enri Emmot. I come from Carne Village, near the Great Forest of Tob." The soldiers exchanged looks, and one of them stepped out of the blockhouse. He was going to check the register for any matching records. In order to manage its residents, the Kingdom kept records of them in the form of registers. That being said, the registers were crude affairs, and the relevant details of birth and death were updated very slowly, if at all. At a very conservative estimate, there were tens of thousands of mistakes in them. As a result, relying too heavily on the registers would be a bad idea, but even so, they had their uses. This register was muddled, but it had a lot of entries, so searching it would take a long time. The soldiers understood this, and decided to try and take care of something else in the meantime.
