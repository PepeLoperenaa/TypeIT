The receptionist's body visibly relaxed as she heard the reply. "Thank you very much! Really, thank you very much! Come, come, let me show you the way." Enri followed after her, bathed in the curious stares of everyone around. The receptionist was tightly gripping her right hand, as though she didn't want Enri to escape. Was I too rash?

It was unoccupied except for herself and intricately decorated, filled with furniture that looked so expensive she wondered if it was even meant to be sat on. "Come, come, please, have a seat."

All she felt was the comfortable furniture taking her body weight. "Would you like something to drink? How about some liquor? Too early? Yes, kind of... how about fruits... no, sweets and desserts, maybe?"
