"This is to make sure the transaction with Nfirea-kun is profitable." "What do you mean by transaction?" "...I'll explain before we eat." Ainz sat on the other side of the sofa. "To begin with, I have no intention to openly market the potion you make. Or rather, without the ingredients I provide, you can't manufacture the purple potion. Do you agree?" "That's right. It's been difficult to get this far, even when we're using the material provided by Gown-sama. There's still a lot of unknown factors, like how potent it is and what other effects it has." "Therefore, a public offer would only cause problems. Although simply asking about the source should be fine... we can't be sure that there aren't any opponents who'll come at this operation with violence, right? ...And from what Lupusregina's told me, your village has suffered a monster attack. There is the possibility that these monsters, seeking the protection of strong walls, attacked your village in search of safety. Do you know why they did this, and did you take any prisoners?" There were none, Enri answered in her heart. When they heard the monstrous roar from behind  made by the troll Enri and Nfirea had encountered  the goblins simply didn't have the time or the ability to take anyone captive, and just finishing the fight had taken enough from them that there were no enemy survivors.
