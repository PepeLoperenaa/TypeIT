Aura turned back to look at Ainz with a baffled face. "Hmm? Aren't you going to turn them into your subordinates?" "The Giant of the East and the Serpent of the West are unknown monsters. It would be better to start with a chat. They are precious monsters that didn't exist in the game after all." "Ainz-sama is so kind." Aura wasn't being sarcastic. "Re-really? I am only kind to those who I can make use of- and the residents of Nazarick... If they are equals with Hamsuke, they should have some use, that's how I see it. Rare items are worth collecting." "I heard what you mentioned just now, but is Hamsuke really that valuable?" "Of course. As a guinea pig." Hamsuke was undergoing intense training as a warrior under the tutelage of Zaryusu. By the way, an undead created by Ainz was also one of those disciples. Would the two of them -one a beast and one a corpse- be able to master warrior skills? If the undead could be taught to use martial arts, the combat potential of Nazarick would increase tremendously. Ainz didn't think it was possible, but he would never know unless he did the experiment. "It is important enough to warrant the blacksmith making a suit of armour for it?"
