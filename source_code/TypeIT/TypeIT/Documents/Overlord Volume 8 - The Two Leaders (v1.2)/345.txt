Since there was never anything in the reports that required his attention, he really just skimmed through them all. It was not an attitude befitting a ruler, but as long as Albedo was around, and there was no emergency, there would be no problem. All proper organizations should be like this anyways. It's not good for someone who stands above others to work on the frontlines. It was a foolish move for the supreme commander of an army to participate in the fight on the frontlines unless he was there to raise morale. It was because there were incalculable dangers. I should give up this adventurer business and gather knowledge to deal with emergency situations- I know I have to train my mind as well, but what should I do? Who's going to be the teacher...? How can I not ruin the image of Ainz Ooal Gown that everybody believes in... Everyone inside Nazarick respected Ainz as the supreme overlord and kneeled before him. That was right. Ainz received respect from his subordinates which his former comrades created, who were, in some ways, their children. Just like how a father could not betray his son's admiration, he could not betray them as well. That was why he practiced acting, in the hope that he could at least appear to play the part. Ainz was fully aware that it was embarrassing. Otherwise, why would he lock the door and forbid the maids and the Eight Edge Assassins that guarded him from entering? Sometimes, he would even plant his face in the pillow and scream "Arrrgghhh--!" when he could not stand it anymore. "Something fitting the supreme overlord of Nazarick... A figure that's respected..." Ainz flipped the page while feeling like he was coughing up blood. There were plenty more lines he came up with in his spare time, and it felt like the finish line was still somewhere beyond the horizon.
