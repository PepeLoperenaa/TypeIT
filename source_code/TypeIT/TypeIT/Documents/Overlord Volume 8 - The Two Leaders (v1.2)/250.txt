The smiling maid prepared the tea for them with flowing, elegant movements. After the cups were rinsed with hot water, in a mysterious and inexplicable way, she made the tea before the two of them. In addition, two different small sized cups were placed in front of them. "Please add the desired amounts of milk and sugar to your tastes." Enri opened the sugar pot. What she saw were white solids that resembled nothing so much as powdered snow. The village girl mechanically deposited several sugar cubes into her cup, stirring them until they dissolved. After that, she added milk. Then, Enri took a sip, and felt like her face was going to melt. "S-sweet!" "Mm, I guess adding the sugar would do that. It's not often that you get to taste sweet things in the village, and you don't raise bees... if I'm not wrong, you only have something like syrup? I remember there was spice-making magic but that's something else entirely..." Forgetting where she was, Enri exclaimed loudly. "Try your hardest to recall it." Before she could hear his noises of acknowledgement, Enri took another mouthful of the red tea, and the taste let her heart calm down. "Really, it's sweet and delicious."
