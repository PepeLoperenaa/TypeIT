The figure unconsciously made a sound which echoed throughout the bathroom. As if feeling embarrassed from its own voice, a slender arm sprouted out from the blue liquid. There was no sound of water drops hitting the floor or ripples on the surface of the liquid. That was because it had abnormally high viscosity. With this outstretched arm, the figure rubbed its face. It was a face which was idolized by many for its handsome appearance. "Ha-" The figure let out a big sigh and leaned backwards, but its body did not sink into the water. The blue liquid slowly lowered and supported the thin figure. Its movement and elasticity was like being embraced by an extremely soft waterbed. The liquid definitely had a will of its own. The blue liquid squirmed before sprouting several tentacles, each about the width of a couple of fingers. They moved as if hugging the silhouette of the figure. Face, chest, stomach, arms and legs... and waist. The creature jiggled as if being content at having restrained its prey. Its identity was "Sapphire Slime", an advanced evolution of a slime. The tentacle dug deep into that sensitive part around the waist.
