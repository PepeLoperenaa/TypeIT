"So it was true, she took control of the goblins by force... the Chief of Carne Village, Enri-nee..." Part 3 The fortress city E-Rantel was dominated by three concentric rings of fortified walls. The doors on these walls were some of the sturdiest and strongest parts of the walls themselves, and they seemed to radiate a sense of solidness. It was a common sight to see travellers on the street staring open-mouthed at the city that was said to be able to repulse any invasion the Empire made. And the people on the streets had surely made similar expressions in the past. Besides these gates were customs inspection posts, manned by several soldiers who were relaxing just out of the direct sunlight. Although some people might question whether it was all right for the soldiers of a city near the frontline to be so relaxed, the truth was that the troops at the inspection posts were there to vet travellers. Their job was to uncover contraband and spies from other countries, so they had nothing to do when nobody was entering the city. As a result, the currently idle soldiers  though they maintained discipline instead of passing their time by playing cards  couldn't resist the urge to yawn.
