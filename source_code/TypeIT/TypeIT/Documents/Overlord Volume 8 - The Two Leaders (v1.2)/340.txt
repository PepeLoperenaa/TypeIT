"Ah, I heard it from C-cocytus-san... Say, do you know where Cocytus-san is at right now?" Shasuryu appeared to be deep in thought. "I believe he headed out with his subordinates to subjugate the Toadmen with a sizeable number of lizardmen for area familiarization." "Toadmen?" "They're demi-humans living in the north eastern side of the lake. They look similar to frogs and aren't friendly with us. They have the skills to tame large monsters, so they're a very annoying opponent for us. I heard there was a big war in my father's time. It seems we suffered a devastating defeat, to a point that one of the tribes had to disband." "They sound strong. Fitting for a species living to the north." This lake looked as if two lakes were joined together in shape of a gourd. To the south was the smaller lake - where lizardmen lived with roughly half being the swamp and other half being the lake. Since the water level was relatively low, there were not many large monsters. Comparatively, the northern part of the lake was deeper with many gigantic monsters and they tended to be stronger. Of course, from Mare's point of view, the difference was tiny. "Aren't those toadmen actually a species called "Tuveig"?" They were monsters that lived in the poison swamp that used to surround Nazarick. His sister had tamed a few of them.
