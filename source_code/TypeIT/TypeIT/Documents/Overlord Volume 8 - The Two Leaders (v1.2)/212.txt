Something was slowly climbing the wall. Something which was far too large to be a human being. "Could that be a troll?" As she heard Nfirea breathing those words, Enri stared at the emerging monster. "What's that?" "Although it's the first time I've seen one, it's exactly like how I've heard it would be. If that's really a troll we're in trouble... Trolls are opponents that even gold-ranked adventurers would have trouble beating. Honestly speaking, Jugem and the others would probably have a hard time." Enri felt the blood drain downward as she heard about something that was stronger than the mightiest being in the village. The troll that was revealing its massive silhouette snorted, and it started looking around its surroundings. Grabbing Enri by the hand, Nfirea dragged her into the shadows of a nearby house. Here, he closed his mouth and whispered directly into her ear at a barely audible volume.
