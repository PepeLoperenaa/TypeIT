Guu's face recovered to its usual ugly form, with intense terror engraved onto it. A fear several times stronger than before was pressing down on him. "You, what are you! Why is my attack not working?!" Ainz lowered his head and spread his arms slowly. "...Death. I am the one who will bring you death." "All, all of you! Kill that thing!" "Well well, as expected of the one with a cowardly name, to break the rules of a one-on-one challenge... It suits your name. That's why, I will forgive you." Ainz announced in a great mood. Bound by their fear of the unknown monsters before them, Guu's minions moved slowly. Even the most stupid person could sense Ainz' power. Even if they hated it, the scene before them confirmed this fact. They were very hesitant in going against either Ainz or Guu, staring at them without moving. "Hurry!" Even so, they weren't moving. It was the same for Ainz. Right now, there was an intrinsic balance that was restraining everyone. If this balance collapsed, the giants would flee from the cave immediately.
