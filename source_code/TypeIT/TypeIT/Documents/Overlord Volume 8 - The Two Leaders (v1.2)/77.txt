"The most normal herbs can do is stop the bleeding, it won't help against blood loss. However..." Nfirea began rummaging through his pouch. "There's the newly-created healing potion. I wanted to hand it to Gown-san, but... could you show me your wounds?" Nfirea walked forward, withdrawing the potion vial from his robe. "W-wait, what's this dangerous-looking liquid? Is it poison?" Hostility flashed across the kid's frightened face as he saw the purple potion. From Enri's point of view - perhaps even Nfirea's point of view - this was a natural reaction. The potion looked too much like poison for him to not be on his guard. However, the goblins were very upset by the child's words, and they immediately stalked over to him. "Oi, punk. Ane-san's the one who decided to save you, along with Ani-san. You'd better watch your words to the people who rescued you. That's for your own good too, got it?" The kid turned to look at the blades brandished before him. Although he was only a child, he still knew that it would be a bad idea to anger the goblins in front of him. He sagged visibly, like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Enri felt that it would be better if they didn't have to intimidate the kid, but she knew the goblins had their own rules which they followed. It wouldn't be a good idea for her to butt in with her human sensibilities. "I-I'm very sorry." "Ah, it's all right. Don't worry."
