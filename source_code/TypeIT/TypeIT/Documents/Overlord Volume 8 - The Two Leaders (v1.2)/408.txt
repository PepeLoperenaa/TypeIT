The barrage of attacks grew stronger with each strike. This attack power, which exceeded that of a human by far, was the greatest among all the opponents Ainz had faced since coming to this world. However, since they couldn't crush sturdy siege walls or make a crater in the ground, these attacks were barely better than scratching Ainz' back. Ainz took the attacks straight on. "Oh look, my clothes are getting wrinkled, can you stop already?" Ainz looked away with a bored expression and tidied his messy robes. He then looked up at Guu as if he just remembered something. "Ah, you done yet?" "Why you, rawrrr!" Guu judged that the sword was not effective and attacked with his bare hands instead. The large fist was like a hammer that would crush normal humans or send them flying. Ainz took the attack that was fatal to humans head-on, and casually dusted off the place he had been hit , as if someone had dirtied him with his touch. Guu halted his attack, his ugly face turning more ugly, staring at the unsurprised Ainz. "So the attack of one who has a brave name and great confidence ends here?" "Your defence is pretty good- Hyaaa!" Ainz, who had closed the distance between them, waved the staff in his hand, and half of Guu's foot was blown off. Unable to stand, the giant fell onto the ground.
