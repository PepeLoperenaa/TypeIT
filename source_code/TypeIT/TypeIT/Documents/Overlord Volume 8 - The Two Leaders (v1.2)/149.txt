herself would be left to the tender mercies of the shrewd members of the Pharmacist's Guild. Enri headed down the road Nfirea and Brita had told her about. Although she had been travelling with the goblins before that, they were all waiting outside the city for Enri to finish her business. Ever since she had set out from the village, she realized that she was alone, and her hands gripped the reins even more rightly. The tension stiffened Enri's shoulders. Finally, unable to stand it any longer, she looked around in all directions and her destination was in front of her. "I found it!" Enri squealed a little squeal of joy. Now that she was here, she probably wouldn't get lost. She handed the reins of her wagon to the sentry standing at the door of the Adventurer's Guild, and pushed open the door. Inside, warriors in full plate armor, hunters with bows on the backs, and magic casters both arcane and divine were walking around. Some were enthusiastically swapping information about the monsters nearby, others were looking closely at the parchments on the nearby noticeboard, and a few were getting a feel for their newly-purchased gear.
