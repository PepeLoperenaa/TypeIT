Mare activated the most important ring he received from his master. Immediately after he teleported, Mare felt something white sticking to his face. It was snow that was flying in the air. Mare's breath condensed into a white cloud which was instantly blown behind him. It was the result of the snowstorm and the extreme cold in the area. The snow and ice flew along with the storm in a frenzied whiteout, and the endless snow covered any trace of footprints almost immediately. Though the weather was designed to make any invader lose track of where they were, it was usually not this severe. Usually, the black clouds in the sky would drop a few sprinkles of snow, and even though this was a gloomy world, the clouds never completely covered the sky. "......Huh..." Mare looked to the left and the right. He used the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown, so he should be close to where he wanted to go. Mare moved swiftly after finding his destination. There were no footprints left where he walked. There was no soft sinking sensation like stepping on snow, it felt more like walking on hard ground. This pure white world without a trace of anybody else seemed to be telling Mare that there was only snow here. Of course, Mare knew with his passive magical ESP that this wasteland was just a disguise. The ambushers knew that he was the 6th floor guardian, that was why they didn't show themselves.
