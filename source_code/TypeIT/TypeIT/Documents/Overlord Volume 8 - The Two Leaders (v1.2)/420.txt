"That's right. If the enemy that brainwashed Shalltear is watching us, they will definitely think this is a rare chance. They might not want to get near Momon who defeated the powerful vampire Shalltear- although the name I gave them is different. What if Momon isn't around and only one magic caster is left behind..." "Will. They. Take. The. Bait?" "No idea, but if they do bite, I will be a master baiter." Ainz made the movement of pulling on a fishing rod with one hand. "Will. We. Send. Everyone. Out. When. The. Time. Comes?" "No, we won't do that. We will scope out the true identity of the opponent first. If they are as powerful as us, or better than us, then acting recklessly would be unwise." It made sense logically, but was hard to accept emotionally. Cocytus muttered: "I. Understand. That. This. Is. Necessary. But. I. Find. It. Hard. To. Accept. This. On. An. Emotional. Level." "We need to investigate slowly and endure until the moment we discover the weakness of the enemy. When everything is ready, we will tear them to pieces. The sin of brainwashing Shalltear and forcing me to kill her is very heavy." Even if the other party was a player, Ainz didn't feel for them at all. The only ones Ainz was concerned for were his past companions and the NPCs here. If anyone came to find trouble, he would teach them the terrible pain they would need to suffer for their foolishness.
