The goblins knitted their brows. "Is there a chance you might lose?" "Certainly. But if that's a barghest, we're in luck. Greater barghests are pretty strong. But from the look of that guy's chains and the size of his horns, I don't think he's of that type. If it's just a barghest, we're sure to win." "Wait a minute. Ane-san is going to stay here, right? You should avoid danger." Enri swallowed. She knew what she was saying was only to satisfy her ego, and her foolish words would endanger not just herself but the others around her. But even so, Enri still opened her mouth to speak. "...If we abandon someone we could have helped, it would be as bad as tormenting him ourselves. I don't want to be like those people who harm the weak. Please!" Kaijali, who had been watching Enri's earnest expression, sighed in defeat. At the same time, the monster's strange bark rang out. They could clearly hear the sound of mocking laughter within it. In response came the goblin child's pitiful wail. There was no more time for confusion or debate. "It can't be helped. Get him, lads!" The goblins took the lead in jumping out, followed by Nfirea.
