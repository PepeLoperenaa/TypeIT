not interrupting their duties, it would be fine to see what their comrade was doing. "Yaho. Working and sweating hard as always!" The sous-chef raised his head at Aura's energetic voice and spotted the three. "It's not like this body particularly sweats either." He stood up and straightened his waist with a grunt. It was an appropriate gesture for someone who was working while squatting, but he didn't really have any feature that could be described as a waist. Because his body was completely straight and there were no contours or narrowing points anywhere, it was difficult to tell whether he really was stretching his waist or was doing it for the sake of doing it. Next, the sous-chef stretched his neck as if it was strained. His head was a mushroom and looked as if a purple liquid was oozing from it, but since it was very adhesive and sticky it never splattered anywhere. "Is that a tomato?" Albedo took interest in the red fruit in the sous-chef's hand. He raised it up all the way to his face and tilted his head as if it was something strange. "It seems like a tomato. It's a tomato you all know very well. Not the type that gathers sunlight to explode, not the type that attacks you suddenly, not the type that glows like gold when you cut it, but a regular tomato."
