There was the sound of wood splintering, and one side of the main gate was down. Enemy ogres surged through the breach. "Kuku, a bunch of brainless fools." Jugem mocked the incoming enemies. They had made a fatal mistake. The monsters had only broken down one side of the doors. Once that side was down, they ignored the other side and forced their way in, especially since they were afraid of being hit by arrows if they remained outside. However, with only one side of the door down, they could only come in one at a time, which meant a lot of enemies were stuck squeezing through the entrance. In addition, they would be caught in the angle of an L-shaped ambush, where all the defenders could focus their attacks on a small number of attackers at a time. "Welcome to the kill zone. Time to die." The armed ogres on the village's side would have an advantage in a slugging match against their wild counterparts, and the defence force had their spears to assist. Any ogres who tried to break down the palisades would be taken down by arrow fire, magic and Agu's alchemical items. The goblins would handle any magical beasts who broke through amidst the chaos. The tactical situation was overwhelmingly favourable to them and there were still the goblin wolf riders standing by in the rear. If the enemy didn't have any magic casters, their victory would be assured. However- "-What's that?!" Panic crept into Jugem's voice. "Is that a troll out there?"
