Albedo agreed. She didn't want to be near anyone who would go around calling those things snacks. Amidst the ominous atmosphere, Aura spoke in a loud voice to change the subject. "Going back to the original topic, are you going to name it?" "Well, if I do, what should I call it?" Albedo murmured while sinking into deep thought. Since she would be riding it, she didn't want to name it anything embarrassing. Amidst all the words and characters, an idea rang out like a song in her head. "What could you possibly be mumbling about?" "Ah, sorry." Albedo answered as if she had just woken up from a dream. "If Ainz-sama permits me, I will give it a name that carries all my feelings with it: 'Top of the World'." "Hmm. It is a good name. Is it supposed to refer to the one who stands at the peak of the world, Ainz-sama?" Albedo simply smiled but did not answer. Shalltear's brow rose to a dangerous angle. Aura interrupted the tense atmosphere that was going to erupt at any moment between those two people.
