Demiurge, who was done, swayed his tail as he walked towards the pool. Next was Cocytus. Compared to Ainz, cleaning up was equally tedious for him, but his four nimble arms hastened the process greatly. Mare followed after, and finally, Ainz was done several minutes later. The pool was large. Warm water flowed endlessly from an exquisite lion head and steam covered the entire place. Ainz watched his steps as he walked over, and saw two of the Guardians in the pool nearby, with Cocytus a bit further away. "Ah... so comfortable." Ainz had the impression that children would swim in the pool, but Mare simply sat there maturely with a towel on his head. The way he talked like an adult even though he had the appearance of a kid surprised Ainz. The position of a Guardian was a tiring job. "Indeed, I can feel the fatigue flowing out from my body." Demiurge took off his glasses and splashed his face as he breathed out, just like an old man. "So. Hot..." "Eh, you said you had resistance." "I. Didn't. Expect. It. To. Be. So. Hot..." "...Don't release cold air because of that. And don't come over here. A bath has to be hot."
