Carne Village was a village with a very small population. As a result, when their numbers decreased, their ability to do anything decreased with it. This was why the villagers had suppressed their opposition to inviting more residents to stay with them. "When I go to E-Rantel, I need to go to the shrine and confirm if there's anyone who wants to move to the village... Really, this is too much for a village girl to be doing..." "All the best, Chief." Enri pouted as she heard Jugem's words. Part of her was thinking, "The nerve of you". After all, they were one of the reasons why Enri was so busy. "I really wanted to come along..." Nfirea mumbled in a depressed tone, and then covered it up in a flustered flurry of desperate handwaving. "I-it'll be fine, I'll take care of Nemu-chan. So you can go without worries." "...All right, I get it, am I the only one in the world who has to go through this? One moment people worship me and make me out to be someone great, the next I have to go somewhere I've never been to before and do things I've never done before..." "Don't be so pessimistic, Enri. There's got to be someone out there who can relate to you." Enri smiled weakly to Nfirea and Jugem as her shoulders drooped, a sign she was losing the battle with fatigue. In the distance, Agu watched from the distance, muttering to himself.
