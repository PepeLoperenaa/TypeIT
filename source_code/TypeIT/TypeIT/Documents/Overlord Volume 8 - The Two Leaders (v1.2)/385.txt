"...Nfirea...?" Ainz cupped his chin with a silent "Umu". Fear began creeping over the faces of Narberal and the others, because they thought Ainz's pose meant, "do you still not understand, even after I've said this much?" In truth, Ainz had made that gesture unconsciously, not knowing what to do with his hands. In a short period of time, Ainz had been subjected to extreme tension and mental stress. Between these two clashing forces, an epiphany came upon Ainz. He did not know how it would sound until he said it, but all he could do was head forward while stumbling through the darkness. "...Mm. I intended to get the attention of the pharmacist known as Nfirea, is that enough of an answer? How shall I say this... what would you do if you got your hands on a potion that was completely different from any other potion that you had ever encountered?" "...Discuss it with someone?" "Exactly! Lupusregina, it is exactly as you said. As I predicted, Brita brought the potion to the pharmacist she trusted the most. That was how I came into contact with Nfirea." Nfirea had apparently said something similar when they met at Carne Village. "Ah! So that's how it is! That was your objective all along!" "You seem to get it. That was the bait for my hook to catch a master alchemist. Although there was a chance it could have ended up in a strange place and caused problems, it was still worth a try."
