"Well, not like there's anything wrong with that. So who's this little goblin? ...Could, could it be!" Enri felt the goblins between her and Lupusregina swapping annoyed looks. "Fufu - Enfi-chan, you got cucked by a goblin? Fufufu." While everyone's eyes went glassy and lifeless, Lupusregina was laughing it up. "What's all of this thensu. A pure, innocent boy's love, trampled just like that su. Ah, what a riotsu! Fuha! ... All right, enough kidding around, what really happened?" Agu's body trembled fiercely, as though he had seen some kind of monster. Although, Enri could understand why. Lupusregina's cheerful expression changed ceaselessly, like a high-strung person under stress. As the smile changed, it revealed the true face of Lupusregina beneath, which was horrifying in how far it differed from the her initial expression. "Aw, don't worry, I won't eat yousu. It's okay-su. C'mon, tell onee-chan all about itsu" "Lupu-nee. We should talk about this later. Didn't you agree on that?"
