Enri felt a terribly wrenching pain in her heart as she watched the warriors who went into battle to fulfil her wishes. All she could do was watch them from behind. Then, Enri thought, at the very least I should stay here and watch them, without allowing myself to lose focus for even a single moment. The four who had leapt out saw the barghest pressing the goblin child down beneath it. The goblin child sported new wounds but was not dead yet, because the barghest had the bad habit of toying with its prey. The barghest's movements stopped, and it stared at the group of people who had jumped out and then at the goblin child. Perhaps it was afraid that its prey had led it into a trap. "Hey hey, come on boy," Unlai said, pointing to himself with his thumb. "Want to play? I'll play with you. Come on." The barghest growled, full of menace. In a natural, flowing motion, Kaijali drew the machete at his waist. The other goblins followed suit. "No need to think so much. I'll teach an old dog like you new tricks. How about we start with 'play dead'?" "Ashaaaa!" As a response to the goblins' taunts, the barghest squeezed the goblin child it was stepping on, and he let out an angry growl.
