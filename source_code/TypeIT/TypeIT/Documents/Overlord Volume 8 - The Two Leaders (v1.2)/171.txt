"...Frankly? Even if you refused, I couldn't do much about it." What Enri saw was the eyes of a man who was honestly speaking his mind. "I still remember that day even now. That horrible day when my friends in the village were killed. I knew the Emmots well. If we hadn't lived idly, if we had built a wall, if we had been on guard, maybe we wouldn't have suffered so much... maybe we could have held out until Gown-sama came to help us." That would be tough, Enri thought. This village also had a lot of immigrants who were survivors from the other destroyed villagers. Their villages had sturdy walls  though not as strong as Carne Village's at the present  but they had still been attacked and slaughtered. But those walls could have delayed the attackers by just a little bit and allowed more people to be saved. Enri agreed on that part. "The old way of thinking I had isn't going to work anymore. We need to reorganize and protect the village's safety with our own hands. The only ones who can do this... are the flexible, the young, and along with this they need strength as well." The chief had said his piece. He looked calmly at Enri. As the chief spoke, Enri had listened seriously to him. At first, she wanted to refuse because the burden was too heavy. If they were attacked again, she wasn't sure she could bear responsibility for the lives of her fellow villagers. However, like the chief said, she couldn't just run away from it. "I don't know if I can accept this responsibility."
