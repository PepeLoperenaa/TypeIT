"Leave. It. To. Me!" The cold air that filled the room instantly lowered the room temperature in no time, making Albedo, who was going berserk, regain her wits. "I. Will. Not. Forgive. Your. Rudeness. Towards. Ainz-sama. Even. If. You. Are. The. Overseer. Of. The. Guardians." Cocytus who put himself between Ainz and Albedo held a silvery white spear in his hand, it was obvious that he would attack if the situation warranted it. "-Pardon my impudence, Ainz-sama. I lost myself back then." "I accept your apology, Albedo." Obeying his master's will, Cocytus stepped aside, but held on to his spear. "I know you are very stressed from your work, losing control is probably the way you relieve your frustration. Anyway, go take a bath and relieve your stress. Cocytus, good work." After Ainz finished, he parted the curtains of the men's bath, but stopped because of the footsteps following behind him. "...Why are you following me, Albedo? Just to be clear, this is the men's bath, not the women's bath." "I want to wash your back for you."
