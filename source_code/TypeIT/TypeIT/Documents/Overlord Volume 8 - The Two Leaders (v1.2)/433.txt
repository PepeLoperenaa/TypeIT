"You are the only one who will say that, I think that's an unpopular opinion..." "Alright, it won't be fun if we are not doing this together. Let's go to all of them one by one. We will start with the normal forest pool. My comrades made them with a lot of effort." "I'm looking forward to it", Ainz subordinates said as he led them towards the forest pool- with Cocytus who was feeling a bit lonesome- in tow. The dense forest might be created artificially, but it looked so realistic that Ainz was expecting monsters to pop out from it any moment. "This place is modelled after an area that existed in the past, the Amazon river. The creator was Bellriver-san, assisted by Blue Planet-san." With his back to the sighing Guardians, Ainz picked up a bath ladle and stool. Why are all the ladles in this bath yellow? When I asked them, they said it was tradition... So all the bath ladles are yellow. "This might sound obvious, but you have to clean your body before entering the pool. The way I wash up will dirty the surroundings, so don't come too near." Having said that, Ainz poured a full ladle of warm water onto his body. An amazing amount of water bounced off without touching his body. Wetting his body in one shot was impossible. After repeating this several times and confirming his body had been rinsed, Ainz took out his brush. After applying a lot of liquid soap, Ainz started brushing his body. There were plenty of gaps between his bones and the bubbles flew all over the place, as if a monkey was doing the brushing.
