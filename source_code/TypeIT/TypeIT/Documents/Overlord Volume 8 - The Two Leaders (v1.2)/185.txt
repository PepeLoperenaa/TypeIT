Of course, none of the villagers would actually say that sort of thing out loud. However, it was true that she couldn't remember any of the villagers thanking them in any concrete way. "...But, the villagers are grateful to the goblins." "They're grateful to you. It's like paying you back for expenses incurred and time spent. Have you ever seen anyone in the village call the goblins by name?" There were none. At first she thought it was simply because they couldn't tell them apart, but when you thought about it, it was because they didn't want to tell them apart. The thought of that filled Enri with an indescribable loneliness. "Is that so." Yet, in her voice was not simply dejection, but her eyes shone with the light of revelation. "That's right. That's why I, personally, feel that you'll be a good chief. If nothing else, when you're chief, you'll change things for the goblins." "...Everyone's going to help me, right?" "Of course. You might as well say nobody will hold back in rendering their aid."
