"I'm glad you understand. Only thing is, there's a small difference with what I said earlier. If they fail next time, we'll wipe them out. Truthfully speaking, I've been thinking of how to impress on those ogres that Ane-san is the strongest." "Eh?!" Enri let out a noise that sounded like she'd been flipped turned upside down. This was too much of a leap for her. Why did a simple village girl like herself have to become the leader of a band of ogres? Wouldn't it be enough if Jugem was their boss? "This is planning for the future. It'll be troublesome if the ogres think of Ane-san as just another human being. Although we listen to you, the ogres won't listen to anyone except us, and that's potentially very dangerous. If anything happens to us at the frontline, I hope that there'll be someone in the rear who can command the ogres." Enri racked her village girl head as she pondered the problem. "Which means you need two people who can command them?" Jugem nodded. "In that case, Enfi could-" "Ani-san might end up being on the frontline too." "I see..." Enri understood, and nodded. Someone in a safe place like herself ought to be useful too. That was what Enri wanted as well. However
