"That is true. However, that will be difficult. Judging from the footprints, they are several barefooted creatures living in this cave. The prints are large, so they must be at least two meters tall." "I see... And that is one of them." They descended the slope in the next second, and Ainz saw the monsters that lay beyond. "Ainz-sama, that is an ogre..." Two of them were carrying something with a bloody scent into the cave . Ainz pointed at them with a wry smile. If this was a dungeon crawler, he would have killed the ogres in silence and proceeded to clear the floor quietly, but this time the objective was a bit different. "...I didn't come here to wipe them out, I need to chat with them in a friendly manner... Hey, you ogres there, sorry for interrupting your meal." The two ogres looked at Ainz in unison and roared. Echoes were loud in the caves, so Ainz wasn't able to tell where the roar in response came from, but it probably came from the depths of the cave. "What a loud doorbell, how tasteless... Aura, fall back." Watching the ogres become more agitated, Ainz sighed. He understood that they had no intention of conversing with him. "Skeleton! Skeleton! Bad!" The ogres came before Ainz with their murky words, swinging their clubs.
