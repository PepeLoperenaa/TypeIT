"--Aa." Another moan flowed out. It was louder than before, but there was no effort to suppress the sound this time either. It was as if the figure had focused his senses on the slime that was squirming around inside its body. The figure in the bath spoke to itself. "...Ahh. I can't hold it in anymore. I can't describe this feeling with words." Murmured Ainz, who was in the middle of a slime bath. He scooped up the slime and poured it on top of his head. The slime that had been enthusiastically cleaning the holes around his pelvis seemed to understand what its master wanted to have cleaned next. Ainz felt squirming sensations around the top of his head. "Huu. This is heaven. Heaven indeed." Ainz's undead body was comprised entirely of bones. Because he did not secrete, his body neither got dirty nor did it smell bad. However, that did not mean he did not need to clean himself. Dust and dirt would accumulate on his body, and on certain occasions he had been covered in his enemies' blood. It was purely to clean himself. Plus, as a Japanese person, he could not bear to not take baths.
