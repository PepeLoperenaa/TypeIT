If she were a magic caster he could understand it. The female leaders of the goblin tribes often used that mysterious power. However, that woman didn't look like a magic caster. Frankly speaking, Agu didn't understand why Enri was placed above the goblins. "It's not like that." "Is that hunter woman that came later very strong?" "Well, now. Brita's not bad in her own way. But we're better." Agu's opinion of the grown goblin in front of him went up another notch. Although he was still short, Agu had the feeling that there was good reason for his confidence. "And then, that woman who appeared from behind you, she's not strong, is she? Scared me to death." The adult goblin suddenly clammed up, and stared at Agu. Unsure of what he was feeling inside, Agu nervously asked his question. "W-what? What's with that woman?" "That woman who suddenly appeared... her name is Lupusregina, and she... she's very dangerous. If you want to live in this village, do not ever go near her or speak to her. It's for your own good." "Ah. Ahhhh. I get it."
