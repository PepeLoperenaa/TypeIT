"Being timid doesn't mean being weak, you can understand that even though your brain is the size of an acorn, right?" The giants and ogres watching the duel witnessed the pathetic sight of their leader and gasped. Ainz sighed weakly, realizing that monsters that could only understand the situation this late were useless. However, it would be different if they were capable of seeing the right moment to escape. "Aura, he is the only one who is not allowed to flee, catch him." Ainz was brief, but Aura understood immediately and took action. An instant later, Aura had reached the Naga who was trying to use 'Invisibility' in order to silently get away. "Ainz-sama, I caught him, what should I do with him?" Ainz ignored Guu who was before him and used one hand to grab the head of the Naga who was still facing Aura. That attitude showed Guu and everyone else one single thing- Guu was no threat at all. In the face of such intense humiliation, Guu ground his teeth furiously and loudly. However, Ainz wasn't bothered at all. "Why you!" The Naga kept squirming, entangling Aura. "I will strangle you just like that!" A calm voice came from within the balled up Naga. "Hey, I can't see Ainz-sama's handsome figure like this. I will rip out your throat if you are too noisy, alright? But I will be careful and not kill you."
