Aura faced the front once again in relief, her silky blonde hair swaying with the movement. Ainz shifted his gaze down that slender back- at his hand that was wrapped around that petite waist. What a slim waist. That's how kids are... Ainz didn't have any children himself and was curious. He tapped her waist and back lightly, as if to confirm something. Ainz did so gently since they were on Fenrir, but Aura still jumped and turned around with a jerk. "Uwah! What-what is it Ainz-sama?!" Her entire face was red, something even someone without night vision would be able to tell. "Ahh, nothing, I just felt that your waist was really slim. Are you eating well? You might have equipment that sustains you without having to eat, but you can still eat if you wish to, right?" "Ye-yes. Eating won't grant any buffs, but I am still eating properly." In the game, humans and demi-humans, who had limited lifespan, would grow and age normally. In contrast, heteromorphic races with unlimited lifespan would stop growing after a certain stage. If this world was like this, Aura and Mare would have room to grow further. Since they were still growing, Ainz hoped they could have a diet as nutritious as possible. With his comrades gone, Ainz was responsible for the growth of these children. "Eat your meals properly, alright?" "Yes! I'll eat until Shalltear despairs!"
