"A village girl? You, why are you lying? Then how could you have obtained a magic item like this? If you really are a simple village girl, how could you have gotten something like that?!" "Eh? This, this is a gift from the one who saved our village, Ainz Ooal Gownsama" "Lies again! A priest from the Theocracy must have given it to you!" "Eh? What's that about the Theocracy?" "Men! Assemble! This girl is just too suspicious!" Although the soldiers didn't understand what was going on, up till today, they had never seen the magic caster freak out like this before. So if this were an emergency, they should drop whatever they were doing and respond to the summons. "Fall in! Fall in!" In response to the soldier's shouts, several of their comrades stopped their cargo inspection and entered the room. "Who gave you an item like this? How did you get it? You can't possibly be a simple village girl!"
