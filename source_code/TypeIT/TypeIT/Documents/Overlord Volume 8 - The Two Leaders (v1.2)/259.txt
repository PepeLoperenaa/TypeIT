It expanded, and gravity eventually pulled the water droplet towards the floor of the bathroom floor. In the Great Tomb of Nazarick, there were many places to bathe. This was one of them. There was only one silhouette in this large marble bathtub which could fit many people at once. A blue water droplet fell along the contour of the smooth white body. The colour "blue" was not a figurative term, but a literal observation as if it had been artificially dyed. When it reached the feet, the blue liquid that had flowed down the contour of the body defied gravity and started climbing with a movement different from typical water. "-Fuaah."
