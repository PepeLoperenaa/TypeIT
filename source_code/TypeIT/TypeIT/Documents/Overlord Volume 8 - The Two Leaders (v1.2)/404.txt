"First, let me clarify, I am not a skeleton. Correct your misunderstanding." "If not a skeleton, what are you?! I permit you to state your name before the King of the East, Guu!" "...Guu?" Ainz couldn't understand what he was saying momentarily. Since it spoke like a king or a tribal chief, that was probably its name. "I see, Guu. Apologies for the late introduction, my name is Ainz Ooal Gown." The cave echoed with laughter. "Fuhahaha! The name of a coward! Not a powerful name like mine, your name is ugly!" Following these words, the giants laughed along in an annoying way. "Cow-" Aura who had taken a step forward was stopped by Ainz. "It's fine. Don't get angry over something so trivial, stay cool. We are here to talk as ambassadors of friendship. For future reference, could you explain why you think I am a coward?" "Ahh, mysterious undead, long names like that are proof of cowardice."
