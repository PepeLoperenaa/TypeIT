"Ah, the penguin's here too." CZ held a penguin under her arm, and a worried-looking manservant was trailing behind her. It was the Assistant Butler, Eclair. He flapped his wings with all his strength, but there was no way he could escape with the strength of a level 1 Birdman. His futile struggles quickly lost their vigor while the maids looked on. In the end, the penguin ran out of strength and went limp, like a wet dishrag. "Shizu-chan! Over here! Eat with us!" "No, come over here! Shizu-chaaaan" "Just throw that butler away! Over there would be fine!" "Send that useless bird to the head chef, at least he'll contribute to Nazarick that way!" There was a marked difference in the reception that the Assistant Butler and CZ received from the maids, but that couldn't be helped. He was disliked because he loudly proclaimed that he wanted to take over Nazarick, despite being a mere assistant butler. Even if he had been created that way by the Supreme Beings, his frequent announcements of those wild words made him difficult to have around. CZ peered through the commotion around her, as though she was searching for someone. The adorable way in which she did so, like she were a child who didn't know where to sit, made many of the maids' hearts beat faster.
