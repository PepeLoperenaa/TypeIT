It looked different from an ogre, but it was about the same size. It lurched stiffly toward the defenders, emitting an oppressive presence as it came. In its hand, it held a greatsword with an unnatural air about it. A sticky substance flowed in the middle of the blade. That must be some form of magic. "The boss took the field? ...Could that be... the Giant of the East?" It certainly looked that way. Its strong body looked like it had been trained until it was as hard as steel and it was completely unlike any of the trolls Jugem knew of. At a glance, he could see how it could be on par with the Beast of the South. Just one troll would require all of the goblins to handle. It was an enemy that was tougher than any they had ever faced. "If that's the case..." Jugem thought about what to do. It seemed hopeless. The best way would be to cover Enri's escape. If she didn't want to, then even if they had to force her "...No, that's not the best way. That's the worst way, and our last resort." Having given up on that course of action, Jugem spoke to his goblin troops.
