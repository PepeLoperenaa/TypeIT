Angered by the loss of its target, the troll returned to its earlier target - the ogres. First, it would kill the ogres and then find that tantalizing bait, the troll thought. The troll, thrashing around the outside of the house in a fury, didn't find any signs of the ogres. It was as though they'd vanished into thin air. "Guuuuu, where?" Looking around, it still couldn't find the ogres, which were still large despite being smaller than itself. No matter how those ogres moved, it should have seen them eventually. Could those puny ogres use invisibility, like their master? The troll had encountered another situation it could not figure out and snorted. However, the strong stink of herbs rising from its own body interfered with its sense of smell, and it could not follow the ogres' scent trail. "Guuuuuuuuuu..." The moaning troll scraped experimentally at the fluid on its body. This time, its fingers stank. Glancing around, the troll found a fallen piece of cloth on the ground. The troll considered that it might be good to wipe itself off with the cloth and picked it up with a curious expression on its face. It brought the cloth to its nose and sniffed, but because its nose still wasn't fully recovered yet, it could only get a bit of scent.
