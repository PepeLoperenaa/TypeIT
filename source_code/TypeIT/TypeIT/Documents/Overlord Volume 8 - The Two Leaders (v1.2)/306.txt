Shalltear glared menacingly at Aura, showing an expression that could wither even the flames of a century-old love. "Did you perchance think I was stupid?" "...W-wait a moment Shalltear. Do you really have to ask, after everything you've done so far? Hmm? Just take a moment and try to remember.." In a moment, as if she had actually remembered all her mistakes, Shalltear's pupils dilated like a dead animal and she averted her eyes. After seeing Shalltear's pitiful appearance, Albedo decided to change the subject. "Uhmm, Ainz-sama proposed this plan as well. When we were talking about the 6th floor, he mentioned his desire to collect various monsters as well. It's not an idea you can come up with a narrow view of the world. I talked about Ainz-sama's talents with Demiurge before, and we came to the conclusion that he's a genius as expected." "Everybody knows that Ainz-sama is a genius, but I have heard that he doesn't speak much." "Demiurge said that, right? Well... Ainz-sama doesn't reveal his thoughts easily. And sometimes he acts strange, but the saying 'The wise may seem stupid and the brave may seem timid' hasn't been wrong so far." Albedo's eyes moistened as she shook her head.
