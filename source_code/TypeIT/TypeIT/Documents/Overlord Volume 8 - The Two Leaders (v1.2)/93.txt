A clear sound brought Enri back to her senses, and her eyes fell on the ceramic cups on the table. They were filled with a transparent fluid that gave off a citrus smell, and Enri decided to help herself to a cup. The cool, sweet and sour taste washed over her entire body, and she felt like she was filled with energy. Agu had sat down beside her at some point, and he gulped his down in one shot and immediately asked for another. Yet, Lupusregina didn't touch hers. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen Lupusregina-san eat or drink. "...Hm? Something wrong? You've been sneaking glances my way recently. Are you in love with me? Ahhhhh, how troubling my, how shocking, to think that En-chan is a lesbiansu. Looks like I need to let everyone knowsu" "What- no! No! It's not like that!" "Wahahahaha Just kidding. I know En-chan likes men." While thinking about how to reply, Enri's eyes narrowed into a straight line. "Although, it's kind of slow... hm? Looks like they've arrived." Enri turned to the door, but she had the feeling there was nobody outside. "Really? But I don't hear anything at all." Agu cupped his ear forward with his hand.
