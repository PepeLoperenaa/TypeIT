Goblins were about as big as human children when they were adults, but hobgoblins could reach the height of an adult human. They were similar to humans in terms of physical abilities and intellect. In order to mate with other goblins, many tribes tended to live in the same region. However, in order not to let the population increase too much, many were left behind as bodyguards or team leaders within the tribe. "But if my father or mother was a hobgoblin, wouldn't they know themselves?" "Both his parents were goblins and he was a hobgoblin." "Eh? Isn't that the kind of weird plot that shows up in dramas?"

Just as humans adopt children, I think the goblins might have done something similar." "That's certainly possible. Well, in that case, we don't have to worry too much about it."
