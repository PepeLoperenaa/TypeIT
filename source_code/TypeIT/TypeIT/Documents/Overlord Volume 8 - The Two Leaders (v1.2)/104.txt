However, when she looked at it from the adventurers' point of view, it made sense. "Well, even if the Guild checks it out, people might still die anyway, that sort of thing happens a lot..." Brita bit her lip. " When I think of that vampire attack, I can't help but shiver... used to be I couldn't even sleep without medicine for it..." "Vampire? What's that?" Agu asked without thinking, and Brita smiled bitterly. "It's a secret. Well, it's more like I don't even want to think about it. You'll piss yourself." "But I was the one who was aski" "You're not in a position to ask questions, brat." "Then we'll go ahead with his plan for the time being and report it to the Guild, and make a request if all goes well, is that it? Although request fees won't be cheap, we'll need to break the bank for this one. Tell Jugem-san and the chief about it later. Can you do that, Enri?" "l'll take care of the self-defence force. Honestly speaking, I was thinking this was the way to go too."
