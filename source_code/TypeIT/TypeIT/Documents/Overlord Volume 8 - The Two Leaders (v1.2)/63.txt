"Ah, well, I think Enfi's amazing..." "Really? I didn't think it was that fantastic. I'm only a dabbler when it comes to herbalism. This level is about par for the course." "...Is that so." "I guess." The conversation ended thus, and in the slow passage of time, the stock of herbs in their backpacks grew. After filling up slightly more than half of their packs, the goblins crouched next to the two of them, as if looking for somewhere to hide. Seeing Enri's surprised face, Kaijali silently gave a hand signal. This was an emergency. Enri, who understood, pricked up her ears. From the distance came the sound of plants being trampled underfoot. "This is..." "Something's coming. It's coming for us... or rather, it's advancing and most likely it's going to end up here, so we need to get away from here for a bit." "...Then, we won't need the noisemaker decoys?" "That's right, Ani-san. It's better if we don't have to use those, it feels like things will go bad if we do. Now let's move." The five of them began moving away from the direction of the sound, hiding in the shadow of a nearby tree. They didn't go further because they didn't want to chance making noise on nearby vegetation. If the other party was just advancing forward, there was no need to risk discovery like that.
