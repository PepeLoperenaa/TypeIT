"No, really, it's fine! I was just looking at him." "That's great, after all, once you're in the forest, you can lose your life over even a tiny slip. If anything's wrong, anything at all, you tell me." "That's right, Ane-san. Just like we agreed before, we're all scouting the forest, so if anything happens and we can't get there in time... it'll be okay, right?" Jugem's brutish face contorted with what looked like an expression of worry, and he glanced at Enri's face. Seeing that, Enri smiled and replied to him. "It'll be fine. We won't go too deep, and they'll protect me." "That's good to hear..." Jugem followed Enri's line of sight to the three goblins ahead of them. Then he shouted. "Oi! You punks! You'd better not let Ane-san take so much as a single scratch, got it?!" "Got it!" The three goblins, Gokoh, Kaijali and Unlai, responded with a hearty shout. "And Ani-san, you'll be taking care of Ane-san too, right?" Enri suddenly noticed that Kaijali, for no apparent reason, was flexing his muscles in a front double biceps pose.
