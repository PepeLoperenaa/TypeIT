Ignoring the goblin child, the barghest leapt at the goblins to meet their attack. A barghest was heavier than a goblin. The barghest was hoping to pin its foes under itself and finish them off by ripping their throats out with its fangs. However, this was a poor choice. The targeted goblin easily twisted out of the way of the attempted attack, and at the same time the other two goblins on the left and right slashed at the barghest with their machetes. One blade was deflected by the barghest's chains, but the other ripped into its body, sending blood everywhere. At the same time, a small hurled vial shattered after hitting the tip of the barghest's nose. "Shaaaaa!" The vile miasma which now clogged its eyes and nose drew an agonized howl from the barghest. And at that moment, three more jolts of pain ran through its body. It could sense that it was in trouble from the outflow of blood alone. The barghest wept, its vision shaky and blurred, and made its move. Its target was the one who had thrown the vial  a human. However, the barghest had only taken a few steps when its feet stuck onto something below and could not move.
