"Hey, after this, use this to wipe your body. Make sure you get all the blood off." Agu didn't look happy about it, but he still cleaned himself with the damp towel. "So we just dump the dirty water outside?" "Yeah, just like that. Ane-san, go have a seat. We'll take care of the rest." With that, Enri headed to the nearby table. It was surrounded by chairs since so many goblins lived here. As she chose a place to sit, she suddenly realized how tired she was. Her arms and legs were like logs, and her head was heavy. Although part of the reason had been gathering herbs, what had really worn her out was the battle against the barghest. All I did was watch... Enfi and the goblins were fighting, but they can still be this active... looks like I'm never going to be a warrior... or rather, Enfi's gotten really strong... Even though she knew that her childhood friend could use magic, she hadn't expected that magic to be so powerful. He's amazing... As she thought of her suddenly-different childhood friend, Enri's heart swelled with an emotion she couldn't put into words. It seemed to be surprise, but then again it seemed like something else entirely.
