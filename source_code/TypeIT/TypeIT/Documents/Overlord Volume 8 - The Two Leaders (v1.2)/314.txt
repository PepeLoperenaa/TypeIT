this. Because Demiurge-sama was so generous, he took pity on the starving livestock. So he made them exchange children with each other, roasted them and put them on the table. If he was heartless, wouldn't he have served them up without exchanging them?" "I-Is that so?" "Of course. He even allowed them to say farewell by bringing over both parents and letting them sit by the table... For there to be someone like Demiurge-sama, who would be considerate enough for the family to say farewell while smiling... There won't be anyone besides the Supreme Beings. I'm sure of it." "I guess..." Mare gave a flat response to Pulcinella's enraptured speech. He didn't care what happened to anyone who did not belong to Nazarick. After a couple of seconds, Mare erased all thoughts of Demiurge's livestock. "Plus, when starving, their head might say yes, but their stomach might not. Demiurge-sama thought ahead and after warning them, made sure they ate it all, down to the last bit. He is a truly generous..." Feeling that the story would not end, Mare quickly interrupted. "...H-how's Guren-san doing? If I want to send the message back, I might need to relay it to him, but I don't know what he's doing and where." "...'he' or 'she', I personally theorize Guren is genderless. Last time I saw that person was when Demiurge-sama wasn't present and it was lying in ambush around the 7th floor's gate."
