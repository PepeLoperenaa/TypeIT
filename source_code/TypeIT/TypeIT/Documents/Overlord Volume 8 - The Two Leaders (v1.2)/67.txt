Although the powerful stench was everywhere, if they fled in haste, the displaced air from where they were fleeing might catch the barghest's attention. "Then, let's use the kid as a sacrifice and be done with it. We don't know how strong this barghest is, and engaging it without prior knowledge would be too risky." These cold words made Enri look at Gokoh's face. However, these words were logical ones. The goblins put Enri's personal safety as their top priority. With that in mind, avoiding combat with that magical beast was only to be expected. They would sacrifice one of their own kind for that without a second thought. The words he said, judging by their conviction, were not mistaken at all. However, Enri hated this sort of thing. Even if they were of different species, not helping someone you could help would disgrace herself as a human being. Who knew, if she had not been a silly village girl who had never known a goblin attack and lacked a sense of danger, she might not have thought that way. Enri looked around to the others. The goblins knew Enri's wish. They just didn't want to speak it. After that, Enri looked to Nfirea. "Enfi..." "Haa... I'll help. Who knows, that goblin child might become a valuable source of information. If we don't find out why he fled here, it might end up causing danger to the village.
