Without thinking, Enri let the words slip out of her mouth. This was the worst-case scenario. A goblin ran up to Enri. "What happened? What's going on?" "We found monsters in the forest. High chance they'll be attacking us." "Understood, now let's go!" With the goblin leading the way, Enri soon came to the main gate. She saw that the night-time barricades were set up and the goblins were massing here. Wearing the weapons and armor Enri had bought for them, they looked like seasoned veterans. As she drew close she could smell a stink in the air, which clued Enri in to the fact that there were ogres present. The ogres clutched their new clubs, which looked spiky and menacing. Along with Enri, a panting Nfirea and the members of the self-defence force led by Brita gathered at the main gate. Agu and some of his fellow goblins, the ones who had recovered enough from their ordeal to fight, stood with them as well. "Is that everyone? How about Madam Lizzie? Did something keep her?"
