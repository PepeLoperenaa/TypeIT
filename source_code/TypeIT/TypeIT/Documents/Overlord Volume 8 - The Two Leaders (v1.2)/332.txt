"C-can it be any kind of magic?" "The decision shalt be thine to make." Mare frowned. It was most difficult for him when he needed to make a decision. He wondered if a regular spell would be fine. Titus reached for a small table besides the drawing table with a parchment laid on top. There was a mound of gold coins gleaming on top of the small table - they were gold coins from Yggdrasil. Some of the Yggdrasil gold melted under the skeletal hands and flowed onto the parchment as if it had a will of its own. The golden fluid flowed to a point on the parchment before spreading out. In the time it took to take a breath, there was an intricate golden magic circle on top of the parchment. "Ready." Mare quickly cast the spell after waiting tensely and he could feel his magic being sucked into the magic circle. A regular scroll would have been complete at that stage, or so Mare thought. Until- There was a scarlet flame.
