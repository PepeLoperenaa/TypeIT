Someone who could remain calm under such a mighty gaze could not be a simple village girl. At least, if she hadn't had experience confronting monsters or people who wanted to kill her, there was no way she could have borne that pressure.

"You mean this?" Enri produced a small horn from her clothing, small enough that both her hands could hide it. The soldiers couldn't overlook this. "...Is that a magic item?" "That's right. You've been deceived by her appearance. That thing is imbued with powerful magic." The soldiers were speechless. If this was an item the magic caster considered powerful, then how mighty was it?
