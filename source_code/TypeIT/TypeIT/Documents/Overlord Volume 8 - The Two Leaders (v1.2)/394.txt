Why did she mention Shalltear? Ainz decided not to worry about it too much. "...Equipment that allow subsistence without food might not be good for growth, switch it out if the situation allows it. In the future, both of you may meet someone you love..." Aura and Mare were cute kids, and when they grew up, they would become a beautiful young lady and a handsome young man, respectively. Ainz imagined the two of them being surrounded by members of the opposite sex professing their love for them... Although he had never experienced this before, Ainz felt embarrassed just imagining it. And, probably from the influence of the conversation earlier, a large number of Hamsukes appeared in his mind. "-Huh?" Aura and Mare being surrounded by a large number of Hamsukes was cute, but it was different from what he had in mind. A hamster is a type of rat, and should be able to reproduce fast. It's only right to spay or neuter your pets... I did think about breeding a certain number of them... Are there any males of the same breed? "Huh!? That's way too early, Ainz-sama. I'm just seventy-odd years old." "True, true. You're still a kid, huh. By the way, who do you like in Nazarick, Aura? What is your type?" Ainz, who didn't have any experience with love, would normally feel jealous when he saw couples display their affection in public, but he would be able to offer his blessings if it concerned these NPCs. "I like Ainz-sama the most."
