"Uhmmm, where would Cocytus-san be?" Coctyus was easily recognizable in more ways than one. If he was in the village, he would be spotted easily and even if he was in one of the houses, his servants would be standing around outside. Mare had looked around the entire village, but Cocytus was nowhere to be seen. "Can someone ask where Cocytus-san is?" "Understood. Please wait a moment." One of the overlords, Aurelius, went back inside the temple. Mare looked at the swamp - the peaceful lizardmen village. There was no sign of anyone being wary of the Nazarick Old Guarders and the lizardmen children did not seem to mind either. They co-existed as if it was natural. Even though the undead invaded this place and they're now subjugated, they don't seem to hold any grudges. Is it because Cocytus-san's integration policy is working well or are the lizardmen naturally like this? While Mare was wandering off in thought, Aurelius returned. "I apologize for making you wait, Mare-sama. The ones working in the temple didn't know where Cocytus-sama would be. But they said that Shasuryu Shasha... this tribal confederation's chief might know." "T-then, uh, let's go there."
