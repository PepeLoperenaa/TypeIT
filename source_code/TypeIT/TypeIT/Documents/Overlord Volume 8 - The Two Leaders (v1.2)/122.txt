They might look slack now, but when they were busy, they were extremely so. It was especially hard to describe the mornings in words, when the city had just opened its gates. With the sun at its highest point in the sky, the travellers began appearing on the streets in small groups, scattered sparsely among the other pedestrians. It was only natural that people would travel in numbers, given that this was a world inhabited by monsters. When they show up, they show up in force; we're going to be busy soon, thought the guard who was idly contemplating the streets from his counter. His eyes rested on a wagon about to enter the street, waiting for some pedestrians to pass. A woman was driving it. He couldn't see anyone else on the uncovered wagon bed. She was travelling alone. He couldn't see any weapons on her either. His first guess was that she was some village girl. As the soldier thought this, he tilted his head as he second-guessed himself. It wasn't anything rare to have people from the nearby villages coming here. However, a woman travelling by herself was a different matter entirely. The area surrounding E-Rantel wasn't completely free of bandits and monsters. Thanks to the efforts of the legendary adventurer team "Darkness", most of the dangerous monsters and bandits had been wiped out. But "most" didn't mean "all", and there were still mundane beasts like wolves and the like to look out for.
