"Then, in place of the toll, could I see your permit?" Normally speaking, everyone who used the Kingdom's roads had to pay a toll  something like a passage tax. However, charging residents this money would cause trade to grind to a halt, and as a result every village was issued travel permits with which they could enter the city free of charge. Of course, as there were different nobles in each region, there were different rules for each region too. "Hmmm, let me see... here it is." The soldier stopped Enri from opening her bag to search it. "Ah, we'll do that. Could you give us your bag?" Enri handed it over without protest. The soldiers carefully searched the insides, and found a parchment. They unrolled it on the table so everyone could see. Although the literacy rate amongst Kingdom citizens was very low, it was a given that every soldier stationed at a checkpoint could read and write. Or rather, they were here precisely because they were literate. "I see. Well, it looks all right. This is definitely the permit issued to Carne Village. I have confirmed this." The soldier rolled the parchment back up and returned it to the bag.
