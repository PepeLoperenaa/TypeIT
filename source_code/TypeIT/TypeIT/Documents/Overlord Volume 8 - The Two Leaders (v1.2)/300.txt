"So I reckon it's a common everyday tomato used as cooking ingredients, right?" "Yes. Since I don't have the skill for it, I can't cultivate any vegetables that confer special effects. Were you interested in it because you wanted a dish made with tomatoes? Unfortunately, I can only make drinks." "No, I was asking purely out of curiosity. Isn't it Shalltear who would want a dish made with tomato?" "...Why do you think vampires would drink tomato juice? Undead cannot receive buffs from eating food at all." "Speaking of which, there are not many people in Nazarick who need to eat." Just as Aura said, most NPCs used items, so they no longer needed to consume food. "It can't be helped. If they started eating as well, the upkeep for Nazarick would skyrocket. Especially big eaters like your beasts would be a problem." "Seriously? Then should I let them go outside and forage there?" "It's not necessary. Ainz-sama, along with the other Supreme Beings, calculated our income and expenditures in such a way that they would be balanced when they created this tomb."
