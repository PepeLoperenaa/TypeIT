"Cocytus-sama is currently outside the Great Tomb of Nazarick, visiting the new lizardmen village." "I-is that so." The frost virgin replied while bowing. "Yes. If you have a message to leave for him, we'll take it for him. What do you wish to do?" Mare hesitated. Since he came this far, he could just leave the folder in Cocytus' room and leave a brief message with the frost virgins. But considering the content of the memo, giving it directly to Cocytus would be fully respecting the master's commands. So how would he go to Cocytus, who was outside. There was no special rule forbidding the guardians from going outside Nazarick. However, there were conditions to meet before going outside. It was because the master had forbidden all independent activity outside the Great Tomb of Nazarick. The information gathered so far indicated level 100 beings like the guardians of Nazarick were unimaginable walking disasters in the outside world. There would be no problem even if Mare, one such walking disaster, engaged in independent action. It would be the outside world that should be afraid of him, but that was a mistake only possible after forgetting one important incident.
