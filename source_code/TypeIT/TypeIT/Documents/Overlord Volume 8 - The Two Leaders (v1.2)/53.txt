"You mean I should take over from here?... kah! Of course! You can count on me to protect Enri!" For a moment, Enri imagined Nfirea showing his shiny teeth as he radiated self-confidence through his smile. His attitude now was very different from his usual one, and to be honest it felt kind of gross. However, that was probably just his excitement about trekking into the forest. Just like a little boy, Enri smiled, feeling like she was his big sister. "Thank you, Enfi. I'll be in your care." Strange, is he doing a side chest pose now...? What's with that? "Ahhh, that again... oh, about that, I prepared a bunch of alchemical items that I made myself, so leave it to me!" After seeing Nfirea's second sparkly smile, the smile fell off Enri's face. "Uh... mm. You go do that." "Ah, well, it's been settled... although. Honestly speaking, even if we weren't doing this dangerous job, this..." Jugem turned to look at Enri, showing her a sour expression. Enri was starting to get a little annoyed after hearing this question again after answering it so many times in the village, but because he was only asking out of concern for her, she couldn't just ignore it. "That might be true, but the fact remains that without the herbs, we can't get any money..." "How about animal skins? We can get those."
