"Really? Got it. Then, just to be safe, I'll come with you. After all, there's still the matter of the ogres." Gokoh spoke to some of his comrades after leaving the meeting place, and then he hopped up onto the wagon beside Enri, who was driving. The other goblins who had been guarding Enri on the road to E-Rantel looked at him with jealousy in their eyes, but none of them actually voiced any opposition. It was probably because they agreed he was doing the right thing. "Then, Ane-san, let's go!" Enri smiled faintly and said, "I'm counting on you guys! And thank you very much!" After thanking the goblins, she spurred her horse into motion. "So, what happened in the village since I left?" "Nothing special. The big thing was that we built a place where the ogres could stay inside the village. Of course, the stone golems did most of the work, and it was pretty crudely made out of wood, but in the end, it ended up being a pretty nice place. However, we can't do anything about their smell. Even the towels we give them end up stinking." "So that's how... but it's still really fast!" "Like I said, the golems did most of the work. If you want to thank someone, thank the magic caster who gave them to us."
