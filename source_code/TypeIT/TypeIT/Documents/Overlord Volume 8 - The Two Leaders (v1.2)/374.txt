"No, i-it's not like that..." "Ah, then what is it like? Was it not a request, then?" "...Actually, it was more of a consultation for a future request. It concerned monsters called the Giant of the East and the Serpent of the West, monsters of the same level as the Wise King of the Forest that Momon-sama tamed. That, er, was it, I think." Momon considered that being too direct and forceful would only scare the receptionist, and continued asking. "Then, will this be a problem in the future?" "N-no! I-I didn't know she was a friend of Momon-sama! If I had known I would have gotten more details from her! It's true!" The sight of the receptionist on the verge of tears perturbed Ainz. Could someone with so little control over their emotions work as a receptionist? "-Guildmaster..." "...Forgive me, I have not instructed my subordinates well enough." "But, no! That was the guild's rule!" After listening to the two of them, Ainz realized that they might have gotten the wrong impression. They thought that since Enri and Ainz knew each other, Ainz could have taken the request for free, but as a way of saving the Adventurer's Guild's face, Enri had come to request via the guild.
