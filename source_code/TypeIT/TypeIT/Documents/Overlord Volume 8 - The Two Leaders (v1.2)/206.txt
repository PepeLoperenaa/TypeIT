The defence force moved as a group behind the barricades positioned behind the main gate. Anyone charging in would be stuck on the sturdy bars and spikes of the obstacle. The arrangement was in an L-shape, leading the attackers to where Jugem and the ogres were waiting for them. For the intruders, breaking through the gate would be like jumping from the frying pan into the fire. "If you see any magic casters, get out of their line of fire!" "Leader!" "What's the matter, Agu?" "Ani-san gave me some alchemical items and there's glue in there, where do you want it?" "Will it be absorbed by the mud?" "Yes, but he said it would only shorten its effective duration." "If it's like that, then wait for a good opportunity and jam up the entrance." After showing they understood, Agu and his tribesmen moved off as one. Kiumei returned after defeating the snakes and immediately headed off to the goblin cleric to receive healing.
