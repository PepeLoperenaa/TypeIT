"...Rejected. Furthermore, I am not alone and will be entering the bath with the other male Guardians. Are you fine with them seeing your naked body?" She might say it is fine since she is a succubus, Ainz thought, but Albedo replied immediately. "Well then, there are family baths in another place-" "Family baths are not meant for that kind of thing!" "But, Ainz-sama. I think it is too sly to only shower the men with your affection." "That's right", Shalltear whose mouth was being covered by Aura chipped in. The idea of going in together made Aura's eyes sparkle, she preferred group activities. Cocytus seemed a bit troubled. Bathing together is showing affection? ...The previous incident too, isn't Albedo a bit odd? Is she acting strange because of that incident? "Albedo, let me say this first. I prefer women to men, and I am a pure heterosexual." Ainz silenced Albedo who wanted to say something in return. "Maybe in the future, a relationship like that might develop. However, while the situation about this world isn't clear, having such a relationship with one of you will be detrimental to the future of the organization." Uuuuu, Albedo furrowed her brows. "And all of you are like the daughters of my friends- the relationship is too complicated."
