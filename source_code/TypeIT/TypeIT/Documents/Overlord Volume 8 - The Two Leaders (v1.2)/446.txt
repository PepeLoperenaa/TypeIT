Overlord Volume 8 Afterword I've been very busy recently. As a result my tummy and chin have become plump. I am the man who is evolving into Mr. Pig, Maruyama Kugane. To those who have bought this book or have it on hand, thank you very much! For the most part, I've been busy because of the animation project, work and other things. Right now the animation is going smoothly, with such heart warming exchanges as "How is Ainz going to smile?" "Just play it by feel!" "Save me, Director!" In addition to the anime, the Overlord manga (drawn by Fukayama Fuginsan) has also begun serialization. By the time everyone has this book in their hands, chapter 2 should have come out. His work makes you feel that "Ainz is a really cool character!" Then, although there's not limited edition goodies for this book, but there's a secret cover under the cover (i.e. the female Guardian bath time picture) This piece of coloured insert art is on par with those of other light novels. It was made from So-bin-san's reckless wish that went something like "no matter what I have to sacrifice, I want to draw something beautiful here!", and I'm sure everyone -- myself included -- has been touched by that wish keenly as well. As expected, it's much better than Kyouhukou for refreshing everyone's hearts. Although I have the feeling it won't be possible from now on, I hope that readers who like this sort of thing will send their wishes to me on postcards. Some people might ask, "Why is the background pink?' The reason is because Editor-san said that pink was the most ideal colour for those people who wanted to join Ainz in the bath. If any of you displays the book with the inner cover showing, I hereby bestow upon you the title of "hero".
