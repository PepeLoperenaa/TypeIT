The purpose of their very existence was to work for the Supreme Beings. When they were told they didn't have to work, it damaged their self-worth and they felt like they no longer had a reason to exist. As such, the maids took their concerns directly to Ainz. They said, "Please don't take our jobs", "We want to do it all day and night", and so on. Ainz shot the suggestion down on the spot. A fatigue system existed in Yggdrasil and while it could be easily solved with magic, there was no guarantee that fatigue would be healed as easily in this world. Even with magic, it would be bad if the workforce was worn down to the point when it could no longer function, like a cog gradually losing its teeth due to overuse. Yet, the maids adamantly refused to back down. Faced with their tears, Ainz gave in and proposed a new type of work for them, which was to personally serve him. That task entailed staying by Ainz's side to attend to his every need and whim, and the maids would take turns filling that role. This offer was as tempting as sugar honey sprinkled with sugar to the maids, whose greatest joy in life was to serve the Supreme Beings. They accepted the order without a second thought, telling themselves that "we need to take care of ourselves and rest well the day before, so we can serve with all our strength when it's our turn." "We need our nutrients so we can work hard, you know. Plus, depending on the circumstances, you might need to skip a meal too." "Of course, when you serve Ainz-sama, your brain needs all the nutrients it can get." "I want something sweet"
