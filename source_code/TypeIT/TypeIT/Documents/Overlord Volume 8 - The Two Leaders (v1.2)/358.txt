"Then, let's go to the Adventurer's Guild and get some monster subjugation quests." They could book a room for the night in E-Rantel, but they could not afford to waste the money. The only reason Ainz, who did not need sleep or food, stayed at a high-class inn was to show off his status as the highest-ranked adventurer in the city and to make connections. However, he was already acquainted with all the relevant authorities and would be welcomed should he ever visit them. Thus, there was no need to stay at an inn any more. Plus, even when he did stay at an inn, he would teleport to Nazarick and create undead until morning anyways. Since there was no point in lingering, it would be wiser to take a quest and leave the city quickly. In truth, he had begun to think that there was no longer any value in staying around E-Rantel. "Is that so? My lord seems to enjoy fighting." "I don't particularly enjoy it. Even if I do accept a subjugation quest, I'll just mop it up quickly and spend most of the time in Nazarick as usual." Ainz lightly tapped Hamsuke's gigantic head. "We also need to train you to equip weapons and armour." "I always train hard! Those lizardmen taught me a lot, my lord. Soon I will even be able to use an ultimate strike!" "If you can use martial arts, that would be perfect. What about your comrade who's training alongside you? Do you think he can use martial arts as well?"
