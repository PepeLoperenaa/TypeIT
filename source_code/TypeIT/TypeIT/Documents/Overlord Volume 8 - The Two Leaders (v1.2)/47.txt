herbalist. If only she could get their help, they should be able to make a great deal of money. After some hesitation, Enri spoke of her plan to Paipo. "I want to go to a new place to pick herbs, could you come with me?" Logically speaking, there was no need for Enri to go herself. All she needed to do was to ask the goblins, who could take care of themselves, to go into the Great Forest on her behalf. However, the goblins she had summoned had a strange weakness. That was to say, they had no aptitude at all for herb-picking, butchering animals, and that sort of work. Similarly to how they handled cooking, even if one handed goblins a sample of a herb, they would not be able to match it up with identical herb in front of them. The surprising thing was, it was as though they were born unable to do that sort of thing, or even learn it, as if someone had removed the capacity to do so from them. Therefore, if they were assigned to pick herbs, the goblins needed to have someone else with them. "It should be all right, but it might be a little difficult for Ane-san to come with us." "Hm? Why's that?" "Well, like Kiumei said, there's some kind of change in the depths of the forest. If that's the case, the inside of the forest would be in a state of chaos now."
