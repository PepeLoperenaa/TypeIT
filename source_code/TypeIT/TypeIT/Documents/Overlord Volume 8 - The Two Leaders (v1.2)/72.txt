Looking down, it saw that the ground was covered a bizarre glue-like liquid. The bizarre liquid was not absorbed by the earth. "The glue won't hold it for long! Take it down in one blow!" In response to the human's voice, the goblins shouted their battlecries and charged. In addition, the human released a powerful spell from its direction. "SHAAAAAAAA!!!" The barghest had used all its strength to try and pull its feet from the ground. Although its movements were slowed because its feet were still coated with adhesive and dirt, it was still able to fight. Watching the goblins close in for the kill again, the barghest used its superior intellect (compared to a regular beast) to accept the fact that "these goblins were mighty foes". It acknowledged that these were different from regular goblins in one crucial way  they were enemies who could kill it. This barghest knew three methods of attack. Goring, piercing its foe with its horns. Biting, knocking its foe down and raking it with its claws. Unlike stronger barghests, it did not have any special abilities. But in truth, it had an ace in the hole. This tactic would completely abandon defense, and it failed it would be doomed. But now wasn't the time to worry about holding back. It had to make full use of what could be the last few seconds of its life. The barghest howled wildly, checking the advance of the enveloping goblins.
