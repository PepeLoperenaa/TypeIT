After getting used to the smell of the herbs, and smelling the fear in her sweat, the troll seemed to have realised that there were two humans. The troll raised its hand and smashed it deeply into the house. Nfirea ran out again. However, his footsteps stopped, and he didn't look like he was going to flee. "Enri! Run away! I'll buy you some time!" "Idiot! Run with me!" "It'll definitely catch up with us! Even if we use the houses as shields!" The wide-eyed Enri saw Nfirea smiling. "I'm stronger, so there's a higher chance I'll survive if you leave me behind!" Nfirea cast a spell, and his body was enveloped in a bubble of soft, gentle light. He continued smiling to Enri, who had lost the power of speech. "And besides  I want to protect the woman I love." Nfirea turned toward the ferocious monster, raising his fist and pointing his thumb to himself.
