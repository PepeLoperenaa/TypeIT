This was delivered in a casual tone. "Frankly speaking, I have no problems with killing them outright. It would save us a big stack of problems. In the first place, people like them who betray others might turn on us if things start to go bad. Agu says they won't, but blindly believing everything a kid says is a little..." "And what do you think, Jugem-san?" "If they could fight for us, it would be great. We don't know how many pursuers might come from the forest, so a few extra meat shields would help a lot." "Then, one more question, will they eat people?" "...Ane-san. Although ogres have a reputation for eating humans, they're just monsters who eat meat. The only thing is that it's easier to catch humans to eat than wild animals." For ogres, it was better to catch humans than say, rabbits. It was only natural when you considered humans were easier to capture and gave more meat too. "Well, if you give them something to eat, they won't attack the villagers. In the first place, they only attack people to fill their stomachs. You have my word that we'll hunt enough animals to fill their bellies. Of course, they'll still need to be supervised and we'll have to see how things go. I promise we won't let anyone in the village be hurt." "...In that case, it would be good if we could trust them enough to make them subordinates. Not just for now, but for the future as well."
