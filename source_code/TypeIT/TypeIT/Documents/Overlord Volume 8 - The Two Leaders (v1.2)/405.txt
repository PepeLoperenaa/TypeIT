The Naga standing by the side explained to Ainz, a sarcastic smile on his wizened face. "The ideas of worthless people. What about you, do you think my name is cowardly too?" "No such thing, this old one has a long name too. This old one is the Serpent of the West you spoke of - Ryraryus Spenia Ai Indarun. Oh, invader Ainz Ooal Gown. This old one thinks their brains are not matched with their bodies, but there are pros and cons to them ruling over this forest." "...You have just saved your life." The Naga was shocked by Ainz's comment. He wanted to ask further, but the giants were still laughing. "What are you weaklings doing here!? To get eaten!? Bones are crunchy and delicious too! I will start from the head!" "I am the one building a fort in the middle of the forest with undead and golems. Don't you know?" The atmosphere changed as Guu and his lackeys emitted fierce hostility, while Ryaryus was on guard. "I know! Annoyance! If not for the nagging of the snake, we would have killed you long ago! Save me much time, cowardly black shortie!" "What a quick conclusion. However, I am here to negotiate with you." Ainz gestured at them to kneel.
