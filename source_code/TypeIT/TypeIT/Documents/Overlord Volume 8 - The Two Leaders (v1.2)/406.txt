"Swear fealty to me if you want to live." "You stupid! We won't listen to cowards! Eat you here right now! And the brat behind!" "Guu, he is the one behind that terrifying building, it is dangerous to insult him! And that is a dark elf behind him! They were the lords of this forest before that demon tree came. They are strong- he is not listening." Ainz couldn't take it anymore and laughed heartily. "Hahaha! Your bark is worse than a dog, meat bag. How about this: I, the one with the cowardly name, will have a one on one duel with you, who has a powerful name. You won't be scared and run away right? If you do, lower your head onto the ground and I will rear you like a slave." "Interesting! Me enough to fight you! Tear you to pieces, and eat!" "Very good. This is your choice. The negotiations have broken down. Aura, go a little further away. I want to play with it by myself." Ainz had just finished when the sword cleaved down towards him. Guu attacked with his three-meter long sword. Ainz didn't move and took the blow directly. "-Huh?" "What is the matter? You think this is unbelievable?" Ainz remained still as Guu's face twisted from surprise. He swung horizontally this time. Like before, Ainz took the hit straight on.
