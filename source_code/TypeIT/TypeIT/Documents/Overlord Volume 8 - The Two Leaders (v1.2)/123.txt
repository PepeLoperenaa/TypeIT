This wasn't unique to E-Rantel; it applied to all of the other cities as well. And come to think of it, could women travel by themselves? While the thought that she might have just outrun the bandits came to mind, he didn't sense any tension or nervousness from her at all. It was as though she knew the journey was a safe one. What kind of woman was she? The soldier shifted his now-suspicious gaze to her horse, and that was when he did a double-take. The horse was exceptional, not something a mere village girl would have. Its condition and coat reminded him of a warhorse. Warhorses were extremely valuable. Even if you could actually raise the money to buy one, a normal person wouldn't be able to get one easily. Leaving aside monstrous riding animals like wyverns and griffins, warhorses were some of the mightiest creatures which could serve as mounts. A normal person would need money and connections to obtain such a warhorse, and a simple village girl wouldn't have those connections. It was also possible that she had stolen the horse from its original owner, but anyone who stole such a valuable item would be hotly pursued and targeted for retribution. This was why bandits wouldn't steal horses or attack mounted soldiers.
