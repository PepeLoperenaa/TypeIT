"...Good? ...Is this the spot? No... Would it be cooler if I extended my hand a bit more to the left?" He returned to his initial position. "You're making too much noise. Quiet down." Finally satisfied with the pose, Ainz grabbed the memo pad on the table beside him. "Since I've finished the pose... I should work on the lines while I have extra time." He circled the phrase he was practicing earlier and flipped a page. The majority of the sentences written on the page were variations on the phrase "I shall consider it." The phrases that were too over-the-top and thus unusable were all crossed out. For Ainz, who used to be an average person, acting like a leader was difficult. Thus, he repeatedly practiced playing that role just in case a situation called for it. Of course, the entire memo pad was filled with phrases Ainz came up with. Even though an hour had passed since Ainz started practicing, he did not require any rest. Ainz was the supreme overlord, but in reality, he barely did anything. Unless there were important decisions or emergency situation that required his leadership, there was nothing to do. Albedo took care of all the details and all Ainz had to do was skim through the reports.
