"Ah, good morning, Kai... Kaijali-san... Huh, it's morning already? I was working so hard I didn't notice. Seeing the sun makes me realize how the time just flew by... ahhh, I've been doing so many experiments recently, I need to get out of the house." Nfirea stretched like a cat and yawned. "Looks like you've been burning the midnight oil, huh" Enri was about to add "breakfast's ready, come over with your Obaa-chan", but Nfirea interrupted. Or rather, instead of saying he interrupted her, it might be better to say that she was overwhelmed by his boyish enthusiasm. "It's amazing, Enri!" Nfirea rushed up to her. His work clothes reeked of that same stinging odor which filled the rest of the house. Although Enri wanted very much to back away from him, she forced herself to endure it, because Nfirea was her dear friend. "What, what happened, Enfi?" "You've got to hear this! We finally managed to perfect the procedure for brewing a new type of potion. This is going to change the world! Even though all we did was to mix the herbs that we gathered into the solution, we managed to produce a purple potion!" The only reply he received was a "Hah?" Enri had no idea how this was amazing. Was the potion purple because they infused purple cabbage into it?
