Although he was quite short, his athletic, muscular body attested to the fact that he was a born warrior. Nfirea wondered Why these kind of poses? But he couldn't actually say that, because he'd already accepted Kaijali's goodwill. Still, there was one question he wanted to ask. "I... I'm curious, why are you guys doing this?

In a tone better suited to coaxing little kids to behave, he replied, "That's because we all want Ane-san to be happy. And from where we're looking, you fit the bill. So the faster you two get married, the better." "N-no need for such a rush! T-the two of us can slowly reduce the distance between us, right?" "...Wrong, actually.

Nfirea's eyes went wide and his face turned bright red as the conversation suddenly jumped to the ultimate expression of male-female relationships in the form of pregnancy. "T-that would be about nine months?"
