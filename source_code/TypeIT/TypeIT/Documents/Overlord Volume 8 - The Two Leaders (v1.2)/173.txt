   As she left the Chief's house, Gokoh followed behind Enri. "Say, I want to think about this by myself, could I have some space?" "Got it, Ane-san. Then, take your time and think about it. The rest of us will back you up, Ane-san. If you need anything at all, just let us know." "Yeah, I'll be counting on you then." After watching Gokoh leave, Enri returned to her own home. Can I be a good chief? Enri didn't feel confident of that at all. Who knew, when the time came, she might have to give an order she didn't like - sacrificing the few for the greater good. I can't do that at all... Everyone in the village thinks too highly of me. For starters, the goblins that everyone says are my strength, they weren't even allies I made with my own charisma and connections. In the end, they were merely summoned from the horn given to me by the great magic caster Ainz Ooal Gown.
