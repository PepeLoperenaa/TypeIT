"Hm, then it would take a really long time for about ten pups  I mean, ten kids, right?" "Ten?! Isn't that a bit much?!" Five children were the average for a farming village family. In tough times when it was hard to survive to adulthood, this number would go up. In the city, this number was usually less, with the help of priests to cure diseases or the use of contraceptives. So, a woman to giving birth to ten children wasn't a bit much, it was way too much. "What're you on about? Ten's pretty normal for us goblins." "We're not goblins!" "Alright, point taken, our races have our differences... but still, you gotta have lots of kids to make Ane-san happy." "...All right, I can't deny that she might be happy with a house full of children... but it still seems kind of wrong..." "Really?" Nfirea was at a loss for words as he saw Kaijali looking at him with his head tilted at an angle. But on the whole, he was still grateful for their assistance. "Then, let's head out, Ani-san. I hope you make a move soon. Although keeping her waiting for too long might cause problems... well, I think a steady, tactical advance on the main objective is a strategy worth pursuing."
