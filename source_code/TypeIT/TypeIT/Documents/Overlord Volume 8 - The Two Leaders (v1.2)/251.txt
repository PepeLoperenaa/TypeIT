At this moment, several knocks resounded from the door. The maid moved quietly over and opened it. "Ainz-sama and your little sister have returned." As the door opened, Nemu rushed in, all smiles. Ainz followed behind her. "Nee-san! It's amazing! It's shiny and pretty and really amazing!" As Nemu hugged her sister around the waist, Enri rose to bow to Ainz, all the while taking care to not let her little sister's feet dirty the floor. "Gown-sama! I apologize for my little sister's rudeness!" "Certainly not. Rather, I should apologize for keeping her for so long." "There's no such thing. We're very grateful." Ainz waved his hand to indicate that it wasn't a problem. "Then before I discuss matters with Nfirea-kun, let us eat." "Eh? We're imposing too much" Facing the panicking Nfirea, Ainz replied with a calming gesture.
