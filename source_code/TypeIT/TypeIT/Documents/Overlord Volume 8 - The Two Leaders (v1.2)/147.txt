"I will do so. So why are you here?" "Ah, yes, I, I'm here, because there's a lot of things that need to be done, for instance, selling the herbs." The woman gestured with her chin, indicating that Enri should continue speaking. "Then, I'll go to the temple, to see if there's anyone who wants to move to our village to live. And then I need to go to the Adventurer's Guild to talk about some things. And I need to buy some things we can't get in the village, like weapons. Something like that..." "I see. I understand what you've said. I will relay it to Momon-san." With ethereally graceful movements which seemed independent of gravity, the woman alighted from the wagon, and left without looking back. Enri's impression of her was that of a frozen hurricane which tore people apart. "She's an amazing woman... it feels like she's ten times more powerful than Brita-san..." There were no girls in the village like her. Nabe had probably become an adventurer because her personality was like that. That made her feel even more troubled about her visit to the Adventurer's Guild. "Ahhhh, oh no!"
