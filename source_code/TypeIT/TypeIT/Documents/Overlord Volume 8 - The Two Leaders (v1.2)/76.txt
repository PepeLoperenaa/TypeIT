The barghest, which knew it had already lost, was desperately trying to get away. Its normally limber body was now cumbersome and slow. That was only natural considering that three of its four legs were now stumps. Even so, the barghest wanted to flee with all its might. But the goblins thought otherwise. Sticky blood coated the grass all around and the stench of iron drowned out the odor of the plants. The goblins looked to the goblin child from where they were standing, bloodstained machetes in hand, knee-deep in the gore and viscera spilling from the corpse of the barghest. The kid had been hurt badly and had lost the strength to flee, but he still forced his body upright against a tree. "Hey, who are you guys? Which tribe are you from?" The goblins looked at each other, wondering how to respond to the questions of a kid who was half frightened and half suspicious. In each other's' eyes, they wordlessly discussed the strategy for what kind of attitude would yield the most benefits and what kind of information they should reveal, but Enri felt that there were more pressing matters than that. "We need to take care of his wounds first. What can we do, Enfi?" The kid was hurt very badly and he had already lost a lot of blood. Left alone, he would definitely die. Although Enri had no idea how to help him, she was hoping that her childhood friend would know what to do.
