Jugem's face took on a dark expression. "What's wrong?" "Ah" Jugem said as he looked to the ceiling, speaking in an irritated voice. "I was thinking about the troll I got this sword from, he seemed like an odd fellow." "The corpse doesn't seem any different from a normal troll. Maybe it was a subrace?" "No, no, I didn't mean that, Ani-san. From its movements, its lack of regeneration, the way it felt when I cut into it... it felt weird... that's right, like a body that was already dead. Something bizarre and foreboding like that." "A moving corpse? Like a zombie?" "I don't know. There might be a species of troll like that" "Thanks for waiting!" The door opened in time with that fresh and bright proclamation. With the sun at her back, Lupusregina strolled boldly into Enri's house. As Enri and friends watched in stunned silence, a pang sound came from the top of Lupusregina's head.
