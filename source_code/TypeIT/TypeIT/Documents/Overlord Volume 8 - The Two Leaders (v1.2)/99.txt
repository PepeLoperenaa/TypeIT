came over too? If it goes badly, the pursuers might end up coming all the way here. Oi, Agu, what other monsters are there?" "There's barghests, ogres, boggarts, bugbears, and some kind of wolf thing..." "They're fairly common monsters. I'd like to hear more about the Giant of the East and the Serpent of the West, specifically, their looks, their abilities, that sort of thing. Do you know anything?" Agu shook his head. "I don't know details. Only that the Giant of the East carries a big sword, and the Serpent of the West has a head like you, but what kind of magic he uses, I don't know." Nfirea, the center of everyone's attention, shook his head. There was simply too little information to work with." "The question now is what are we going to do? If something that can fight evenly with the Beast shows up, frankly speaking, we're done for. The most the self-defence force can do is take the women and children to safety." "Indeed. If all we needed was a sturdy defense then it would be fine, or maybe we should think about some other methods. If the disturbance in the forest blew over by itself, it would be great." To the people who lived outside the forest, if the matters in the forest settled themselves, they wouldn't need to move. However, if they were completely unable to enter the forest, that would cause a lot of problems in its own right. In the worst case, they would have to make painful sacrifices to keep going.
