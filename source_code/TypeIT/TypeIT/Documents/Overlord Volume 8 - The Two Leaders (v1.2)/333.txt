Something that should not have happened occurred. As Mare watched on in panic, the parchment burned up like high alcohol content liquor and vanished within the blink of an eye. There was no trace of what had happened, as if it had been an illusion all along. Not even the smell of burning remained. But there was one piece of evidence that spoke of what had taken place. It was the ashes from the parchment. Titus picked up the ashes as if he had expected it to happen. "T'would seem, it cannot hold a 4th tier spell. The puissance of the wonderworker changeth nought about the outcome." Titus wrote down a memo saying "Heat - ten year's old skin cannot withstand" while grumbling. "Uh, w-why was it like that? Did I?" "Thou doth need not mind. Mine experiments with the bounty of this world hath been devised to limit the depletion of Nazarick's reserves. But surely this harvest must be of a base quality." There were limits on what kind of materials could be used for scrolls, depending on the tier of magic they were intended to contain. For example, regular parchment could be used to store 2nd tier magic, but nothing above that. A scroll made with materials of the highest tier, like dragonhide, could contain even 10th tier magic.
