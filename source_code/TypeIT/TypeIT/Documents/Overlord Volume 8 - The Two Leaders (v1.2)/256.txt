Nemu looked at Ainz with worshipful eyes, muttering "so amazing" to herself. Enri felt the same way. This was too far removed from the world she usually lived in. Wealthy people could spend money on luxuries. And being able to eat, not just to fill one's stomach, but for nothing more than pleasure, was part of that. Wealth, knowledge and power. A magic caster who had all of these. He was a being that Enri as a simple farmer had no hope of reaching, a person better referred to as a king who stood above the tops of the clouds. This masked magic caster was such a formidable individual. "Then, let's go. Although, I don't intend to join you. The three of you - that's right, this family of yours should enjoy the meal with no reservations. After that, we will discuss business. Ah, I need to tell Lupusregina that I'm adding one more person to the list." "Eh? What's that, Gown-sama?" "No, it's nothing, Nemu."
