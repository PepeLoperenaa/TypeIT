"Next, state the reason why you're coming to E-Rantel." "Yes. Firstly, I'm here to sell the medicinal herbs that we've picked." The soldiers looked outside at the wagon, whose urns were currently being searched. "And what are the herbs you're selling?" "Four urns of Nyukuri, four urns of Ajina and six urns of Enkaishi." "Six urns of Enkaishi, you say?" "That's right." Enri was proud of this, and it showed on her face. The soldier understood why. After all, when manning a checkpoint, one eventually picked up a working knowledge of medicinal herbs. Enkaishi only flowered for a very short time and could only be gathered during that time, but it was a major ingredient in healing potions. The demand was very high, and thus the price was always good. If she had six urns like she said, that meant that she would have a lot of money when she sold them off.
