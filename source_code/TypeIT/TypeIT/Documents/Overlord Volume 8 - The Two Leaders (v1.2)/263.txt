It did spray soap bubbles all around him, but Ainz didn't have to clean the bath. That was the job of the maids, and they were happy to have something to clean. It was like killing two birds with a single stone. But even this idea had a downside to it. He could not confirm whether his body was really clean. Just like how some people get cavities even though they brush really well, he was always worried about whether he had truly cleaned his body thoroughly. Thus, Ainz arrived at the last and final solution of dumping slimes all over his body. "Of course... this was revolutionary and ingenious. It's the perfect plan." Ainz murmured while watching the sapphire slimes crawling around his body. He nodded with satisfaction at his own idea. Perhaps this was his best idea so far since coming over to this world. "The more I think about it, the better it seems!" Praising himself over and over again, Ainz looked at the slimes scouring all parts of his body. Very lovely indeed... Even though they were a dangerous monster that could melt flesh with acid and were strong enough to bend metal bars, they cleaned Ainz's body extremely well. In some ways, he felt as if they were his pets.
