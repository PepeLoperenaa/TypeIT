how the receptionist would react if she used this horn as payment. It would be great to see the look on her face, but Enri knew she would never do such a thing. This item had been given to her by that great magic caster with the instruction to "use it to protect yourself". She couldn't sell it off, not even for the village's sake. She couldn't do such an ungrateful thing. "Understood. Then, please tell me how much the fees will be. That way I can go back to the village to discuss things." "If it's like that... then how about this? Please come back after the inspection for the herb sales are done, that way we should have finished calculating the amount." After thanking the receptionist, Enri left the counter and sat on a sofa in the lounge, staring at the ceiling to while away the time while the inspection dragged on. So tired... Every moment since she'd entered the city gates had been a grand adventure. Or rather, when she thought about it, ever since the day her parents had died, the confusing things had just piled on. All I wanted was to lead a simple, unchanging life in the village... As she thought about the things she'd lost, Enri sighed.
