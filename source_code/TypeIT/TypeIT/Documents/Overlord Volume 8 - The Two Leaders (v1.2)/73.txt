"Reinforce Armor!" The spell from behind, cast by the human, made the goblins' armor glow brightly. The barghest panicked, predicting that it was some sort of enhancement spell, but the goblins in front of it simply grinned. Maybe it made them reckless, but with their armor reinforced, the goblins advanced as one. Perhaps it might be called a foolish move, but then one could also say it was a brave step forward to quickly end what could be a long battle. That was what would have happened - if the barghest had not expected them to do this. If a barghest could change its facial features as easily as a human, it would have smiled to itself. The chains on its body made the sounds of a snake. Then, the chains binding the barghest suddenly came to life.
