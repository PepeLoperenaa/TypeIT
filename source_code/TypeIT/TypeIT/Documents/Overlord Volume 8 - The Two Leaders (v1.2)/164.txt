Speaking of which, what happened to that miniature gobbo of yours?" "...He's fine. I think he should be in the Chief's house." "Why the Chief's house?" "Ah, could you help the goblins from my tribe, or something like that. They're staying there while we build a place for the goblins to stay in the village."
