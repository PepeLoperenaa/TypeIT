"Ah, yes! That's right, we don't have time to waste on talking!" The two of them ran to the front gate. Because they'd started running from the rear gate, which was furthest away, even if they ran at top speed, it would take them a while to get there. And with them panting for breath, there was no way they could start fighting right away. In order not to let haste make waste, they proceeded at a moderate speed. However, they only ran for a few seconds. The two of them heard a stomach-churning sound and halted in their tracks. Looking back, they saw someone watching them from above and behind. It was abnormally huge, far larger than a human being. They couldn't comprehend it in the moment that they saw it, but that was its true form. It had a hand on the rear gate, which stood four meters tall. "That, what's that? A giant?" "I don't know! Ah-" Nfirea's words cut off halfway, and his mouth hung open. Enri frantically turned to look at what had stunned him and ended up making the same expression.
