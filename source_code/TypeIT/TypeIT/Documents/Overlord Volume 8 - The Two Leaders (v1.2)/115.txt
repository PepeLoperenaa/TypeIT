"But... can I control the ogres?" "That's what we're about to do, Ane-san. How good are you at acting?"    Jugem brought them to the village gate and then to a side door. Beyond it were five ogres kneeling on the ground. They were also the source of the stench that had been hanging in the air. Surrounding them were the goblin troops, all of whom were present and unhurt. On one side of the door was an observation platform, which would normally have been manned by villagers or goblins, but not now. The goblins had temporarily left it. Nfirea was there too, along with the somewhat distant Agu. "Yo, Enri. Nice night?" "Yeah, Enfi. The moon's really pretty." "Indeed. It's so clear." "Well, excuse the interruption. We're a little early, but let's begin." Jugem yelled out as he heard Enri's words. "Oi! You lot! Our Ane-san is here! She holds your lives in her hands!"
