She had received two horns from Ainz Ooal Gown. Although one of them had disappeared after she used it, the other was safely hidden in Enri's home. "Forget about that, Ane-san. We'd rather you just blow the horn instead." "Of course, there's no way I'd sell it." Enri didn't want to become the sort of despicable person who would sell off a gift given out of goodwill. There also existed the possibility that it might not even be possible to sell it off, so she decided not to do so. Even now they were still benefiting from the generosity of the maid who had brought the golems to the village. She would never commit such an ungrateful deed. "But that's going to be problematic. The herbs can only be gathered in this season, so although it's a bit dangerous, I still have to..." Enri smiled to Nemu, who had a worried expression on her face. She didn't want to hurt the last surviving member of her family, nor did she want to pass up this chance to make lots of money. Although, when she considered her priorities, that was clearly a mistake. Rather, she should bet her life for the good of the entire village and repay the goblins who considered her their mistress. I need to earn more money and see what kind of gear I can buy for the goblins. Full body armor looks like it could protect very well. Speaking of full body armor, there's that gentleman in the black-colored armor... what was his name again? Although she didn't know how much armor and weapons cost, she was fairly certain that it wouldn't be a small sum. At this moment, Paipo held out his hand in front of Enri, indicating that she should hold on a little.
