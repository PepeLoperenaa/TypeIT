"Because Ainz-sama's name is brave, and the weird name Guu is cowardly. Right, snake?" "Yes, Yes! This is proof of the greatness of Ainz Ooal Gown-sama!" After hearing the cute, girly voice and the pained voice on the verge of tears, Ainz nodded repeatedly. "I see, I see. That make sense. Cowards have short names- Ainz Ooal Gown is the name of the brave and mighty." "-Why you!" "Shut up, coward." Driven by terror and wrath, Guu attempted a cleaving attack. Ainz didn't dodge or block, hitting back with his staff directly. Ainz did not allow the sword to parry the attack or Guu to dodge. The staff blasted part of Guu's body away. "Guwaaargh!!" Amidst the terrible screams, Guu's minions who were watching the battle cowered in fear. "As expected of trolls, you recovered thanks to your regeneration ability. But it still hurts right? That was the strongest hit I have thrown so far, you coward who wants to protect himself from my attack." Before Ainz was a head that was half the thickness from before. Normal creatures would have died instantly, but the giant's head was slowly recovering.
