"Ah, thank you." "No, no, it's nothing Ane-san should thank me for." Although Paipo waved his dirt and grass-stained hands to ward off Enri's thanks, Enri still felt that she owed the goblins a debt that could never be repaid. After losing her parents, Enri was in a dire situation, where tending her family's plot by herself would be impossible. She wanted to ask the other villagers for help, but given the overall lack of manpower in the village, it was already hard enough for every household to take care of their own crops. With the help of the goblins, that problem was easily resolved. In addition, she was hardly the only one the goblins had helped. Turning to the direction from which her name was called, Enri saw a busty woman standing by a field. Beside her was a goblin. "Thank you so much, Enri-chan. Because of Goblin-san's help, the field work's almost done." "Really? That's wonderful. It was their idea to help out with the village chores, so if you want to thank someone, you should thank them." "Ah, I've already thanked Goblin-san. He said that he was only your subordinate, so he hoped that I would thank Ane-san as well." Hearing the word "Ane-san" made Enri furrow her brows, which was quickly followed by faked laughter to drive it off. The goblins themselves had suggested that they should help the households who had lost farmhands in the attack, and the woman before her was one of those people.
