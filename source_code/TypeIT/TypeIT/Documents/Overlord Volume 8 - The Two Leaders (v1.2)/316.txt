his sister, Mare quickly scanned the page. He blinked a couple times after he finished reading it. This... it's more like a message Ainz-sama sent to the guardians than a memo. The message was addressed to only the male guardians and praised them for their usual hard work. The following content could be summarized as invitation to take a bath together if they had time. The names of the participants listed were Ainz, Demiurge, Mare and Cocytus. The first two people had circled 'participating' between the choice of participating or not participating. Normally, Sebas' name would be there as well, but he was out gathering information in a human city with Solution. Uh, what's the date going to be... There was a side saying that the date was undetermined and will be arranged for the most convenient date for the participants. There was no reason to hesitate in circling the "participate" option. The message said it would be fine for them not to participate, but Mare just couldn't refuse a proposal from his kind and generous master. No, there would not be anyone in the Great Tomb of Nazarick who would refuse. Mare picked up the pencil that was included in the file and circled the "participating" next to his name. "...Ehehe." He smiled while looking at the circle beside his name, but dark clouds soon shrouded his heart.
