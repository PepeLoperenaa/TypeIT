"And Lupusregina-san, right?" "...Let's not talk about her for now. I don't want to do anything related to thanking her. Something about her just pisses me off." Enri found it hard to believe her ears. This was the first time Gokoh had ever spoken ill of someone. "How should I put it... she's very scary, like a monster watching us... I don't think Ane-san's sensed it yet..." "But she's the maid of the one who saved our village, Ainz Ooal Gown, so she can't be that bad." "...Ah, what a pain" Enri and Gokoh's shoulders twitched. Speak of the devil... Enri looked back frantically, and just like the day before, the maid was sitting on the wagon bed like she belonged there. "Really, En-chan, it's such a pain." "What do you mean?" "Maybe, maybe before that, you should tell us how you appear out of nowhere."
