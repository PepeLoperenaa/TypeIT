They trained the defence force to land arrows on the other side of the wall. That meant learning how much force to use, and practicing the right angle to shoot at in order to accurately hit a specific area. It was training that was completely useless outside of very specific circumstances. However, since the enemy's aim was to break down the gate and they were massed in front of it, single-mindedly attacking the gate, the training was very effective. The main gate trembled under the fearsome cries of the monsters, and the nearby walls shuddered as well. "Very good! Enemies are at the target area! Suppressive fire  begin!" "Begin!" In response to Jugem's shout, the goblin archers on the watchtowers  Shuringan and Gurindai  began shooting. As long as their target was within their line of fire, the marksmen of the goblins would not miss. Screams of agony rose up from the other side of the door. The defense force shuddered in fear and tension, as though they would be swallowed up by the air which was filled by the awful din of the battlefield. Amidst all this, Jugem shouted once more. "Defence force  hold! Do not raise your bows until ordered!" They were told not to shoot when the enemy had reached the place they had spent countless hours learning to shoot. However, in the next instant, everyone who looked at the towers understood why.
