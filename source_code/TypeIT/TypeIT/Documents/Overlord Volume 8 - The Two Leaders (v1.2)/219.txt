If she knew when it would be over, she might be able to will herself to keep fleeing until the last moment. However, without knowing when the battle at the gate would be over, without knowing when the others could come and help her, she was filled with uneasiness, which diminished her strength. Enri regretted not sending someone over to the main gate to make a report, but the preparations had taken too long. She ran with all her strength, rushing into the house where Nfirea was waiting. In turn, Nfirea rushed out of the back door, wearing the same cape and robe that she was. Enri held her breath, gulping and hoping that the enemy hadn't seen through their scheme. The troll continued chasing Nfirea, not having noticed the switch. She calmed her ragged breathing and clasped her hands in delight. Trolls were far superior to humans in strength, stride length and physical ability, therefore a single person running away would definitely be caught. In order to recover stamina for extended periods of movement, they decided to switch with each other without letting the enemy notice. This was intended to draw out the chase, and also to keep it from going to the rendezvous point where the people were. The question, then, was how to deceive it. How could trolls tell humans apart? Maybe if they lived together long enough they would have a few ways, but this was not nearly long enough.
