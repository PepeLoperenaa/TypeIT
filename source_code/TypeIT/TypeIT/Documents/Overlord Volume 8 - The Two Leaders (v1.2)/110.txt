Enri frowned. What could there be so late at night? Then again, it was precisely because it was so late at night that meant it had to be important. She gingerly separated herself from Nemu and the blanket and slowly got off the bed, moving carefully so as not to wake her little sister. The boards creaked as she got out of bed, making Enri's heart beat faster as she worried about waking Nemu. After that incident, Nemu had to sleep with Enri at night, so severe was the trauma she suffered. Enri had no intention of scolding her for it. If pressed for the reason why, it would be because Enri felt safer when she slept with her sister. But she knew, even when the two of them were together, Nemu would sometimes be awoken by her nightmares. Because of that, Enri insisted on being with Nemu even when she was sound asleep. Quietly, and therefore slowly, she inched toward the threshold, but the knocking didn't stop. Enri nervously peeked out the window, and Jugem's silhouette was illuminated by the moonlight. She sighed in relief. In order not to wake Nemu, Enri quietly spoke outside the window. "Jugem-san, you're safe." "Yeah, Ane-san. In the end, it was all right. I'm sorry I woke you up, but some things I think you should know early."
