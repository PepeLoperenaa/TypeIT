"B-because I th-thought it wasn't a big deal, s-so I didn't report..." For some reason, the sight of the frightened battle maid peeking up at him only incensed him further. "Lupusregina Beta! I am thoroughly disappointed in you!!" Lupusregina was not the only one who flinched at this. Nabe and Sixth were trembling too, and the Eight Edge Assassins on the ceiling seemed to have froze up as well. "I gave you the task of taking care of the village, but that did not mean you could do as you please! You were told to report anything that happened in the village, anything at all, so what is the meaning of this!" "That's..." Ainz's face twisted as he looked down on Lupusregina, who was unable to answer him. This was an unforgivable sin for a worker; no, for anyone.

Discuss issues as they came up. They were considered the lifeblood of a company's operations, and they were very important.
