something like that with the guildmaster. He decided it was the right answer to keep their relationship strictly professional. Being too closely entangled with an organization will cause problems. As an adventurer, I don't want to be too closely associated with a city. It's about time that I found somewhere else to be. But before that... Ainz peered at the guildmaster through the slit in his visor. Why does he have to sit beside me? Isn't that normally Narberal's place? Having him sit there is weird. Their proximity made Ainz feel uncomfortable, and it made him question the guildmaster's sexuality. I heard from the leader of the Magician's Association that the guildmaster has a wife... or is that just a sham? Although it seems like he's just trying to deepen our relationship... there must be some kind of ulterior motive behind it. Or maybe he thinks I play for the other team? The very thought made Ainz break out in nonexistent goosebumps. Ainz was strictly heterosexual... or rather, he used to be. As an aside, Suzuki Satoru was a fan of big breasts. That trait endured even into his current existence as an undead being. Rather than, say, Cocytus, Ainz felt more desire for Albedo. Ainz shifted his seat away from the guildmaster and turned so that he was looking the man face to face. "Forgive my rudeness. In truth, I came here to ask a favour of you. One of my friends has come to the Adventurer's Guild with a request. Could you tell me what that request is about?"
