"Sorry to bother you." Ainz was all smiles- although he didn't actually have an expression as he was a skeleton- and couldn't suppress his grin. - Right now, this is the best place in Nazarick. Ainz' smile deepened when he heard the child's voice say: "I need to wash here too". "Thank you, Mare. Now, let me help you wash up, you don't need to hold back." Ainz turned the panicky boy around, and filled Mare's towel with suds. Ainz washed carefully and made sure to apply enough force, relaxing more than when he was being washed. "Does it hurt?" "No, no problem!" After cleaning up Mare's unusually stiff back, Ainz returned the towel to him. "You can do the front yourself right?" "Of-of course!" Ainz picked up the brush and scrubbed his ribs carefully, taking care not to splash water onto Mare who was cleaning besides him. "Well then, I will make a move first."
