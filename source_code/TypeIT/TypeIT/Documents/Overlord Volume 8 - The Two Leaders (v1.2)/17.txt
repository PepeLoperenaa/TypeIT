If I ended up like how the goblins described, it wouldn't be good... Enri swept the goblin's idealized, hyper-muscular final form of herself from her mind, and began serving breakfast. That too was a tedious task. While the goblins wouldn't quibble over a small difference in portion size, the amount of meat in their soup was a huge issue. Enri ensured that everyone's dishes and bowls had a similar amount meat before moving onto the next task. Sweat was dripping from her forehead by the time breakfast was ready. "Then, let's call everyone and Nfirea over." "Got it" "I'll go! Let me do it! I want to do it!" As Enri turned around, she saw Nemu standing behind her with eyes alight. "Have you done your chores?" Her sister nodded by way of reply, and so did Enri. "Really? Then go get Nfi" "No! I want to call the goblins!" Enri had no idea how to answer her little sister's sudden outburst. Kaijali nodded gently to Nemu, presumably indicating that he would entrust her with that task. "I'll leave that to you, then, I'll go get Nfirea."
