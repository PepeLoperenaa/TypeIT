"Hey, are humans a race with good hearing?" "That, that, I don't know about that, but I don't think Lupusregina-san would lie about this sort of thing... though she might... prank people a little." Then is she lying? Agu thought as he stared wide-eyed at Lupusregina. "No, really, I heard them. They're coming for sure. You're pretty amazing." "Hm? Ah, that's not the case at all. Compared to Enri-san over there, I'm nothing much." Agu seemed to swallow it up, and looked back at Enri with a surprised expression. No, that's not how it is. That smile on Lupusregina-san's face is so damn fake! Enri wondered how she should tell Agu the truth, but before that, a knock came from the door. Shortly after, Nfirea and a woman in leather armor entered the room. Brita, the former adventurer, had moved into the village after Nfirea. Originally, she had been an adventurer in E-Rantel, but had retired after certain events. Even so, she still needed to earn a living, and so she responded to the village's solicitations and moved here. She was studying to be a ranger, and she had potential. Even though she was weaker than Jugem, she was still one of the strongest people in the village and the leader of the village's self-defense force (even though it still wasn't at a level where it could be described as such).
