"Amazing! It's so amazing!" Nemu shouted at the top of her voice as she ran. She ran down the two lines of maids, and towards Ainz. Faced with a world that overwhelmed her senses and heart, she abandoned her restraint and let herself run wild. "It's super duper amazing!" "Nemu! Come back!" Enri started running a fraction of a second later. Nemu's disgraceful behavior was making sweat form all over Enri's body. But was it really all right for a mere village girl like herself to run in a divine realm like this, flanked by beautiful maids? Enri hesitated, and her feet betrayed the conflicting emotions in her. In the end, she ended up moving like a half-dead frog, starting and stopping, her mind running through all the worst-case scenarios that could result. While Enri was still limping along, Nemu had already reached the side of the village's savior without resistance. "Is it that impressive?" "Yup! It's really amazing!"
