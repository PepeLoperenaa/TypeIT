"Mm, that's right. Sadly, we can't do that. The most we can do is confirm that the forest seems peaceful, but even that needs time. And if we want to find out when tensions are going to run high again, that'll take even more time. If they did that, they would miss the opportunity to gather the desired herbs. After hearing Dyno's words, a firm conviction gathered in her eyes and she made her reply. "It'll be fine, we won't go too deep." After hearing her repeat that answer several times, Jugem realized that he couldn't change Enri's mind. Instead, he looked to the three goblins who would travel with her. What he told them was the same as what he had said to them before. "We won't be able to protect Ane-san, so you guys are going to have to do it for us. You'd better keep her safe! And Ani-san too!" "Got it!" "It would be safest if we'd all stuck together as usual. Splitting up our fighting strength is just asking for trouble." Dyno muttered under her breath. "If we did that, then we'd be forced into reacting to the enemy, right?" "That's right. If any of the monsters coming to the village decide to settle down in the forest, getting rid of them for good would be extremely troublesome. Once they build a nest, they'll never leave. Even if we chased them away, they'd come right back after a while."
