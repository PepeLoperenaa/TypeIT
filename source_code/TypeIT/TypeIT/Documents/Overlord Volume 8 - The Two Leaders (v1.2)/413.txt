It would be a hassle if they ran away... A hassle to hunt and kill them one at a time. "You are right, playtime is over." Ainz activated an ability he hadn't thought much of- but which was a powerful force in this world. 'Despair Aura V'. An aura radiated out with Ainz at the center. Like puppets with their strings cut, the trolls, ogres and Guu all fell to the ground. The monsters laid there without moving. It was obvious that the flames of their lives had been extinguished. The fearful voice of an old man echoed in the silent cave. "What, what did you do, my lord?" The naga did its best to keep away from Ainz, twisting its body. Ainz looked back at it. "I used a special skill. Trolls might have regenerative abilities, but that doesn't mean they can resist instant death attacks... All of you don't have much value, but you might still be useful. However, if you reject my rule, you will be disposed of." "This old one is happy to serve under your rule! The weak submitting to the strong is only natural. This old one will brave hell for you with no hesitation!"
