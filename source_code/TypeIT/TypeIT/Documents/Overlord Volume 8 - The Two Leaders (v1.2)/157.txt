"Ah, there's no need to go to that extent..." The dramatic change in the receptionist's attitude was starting to scare Enri. In the first place, she hadn't felt that the receptionist was treating her coldly. She had reacted naturally, without such extreme emotions. At the very least, it seemed much more normal than she did now. But why had this leopard changed its spots? Was it because of the horn again? "No, no, what are you saying? Anything is possible for you. We can provide liquor, brandy, and the snacks to go with them too." "No, there's really no need... and besides, I'm running out of time. Can we start discussing the matter?" "Certainly! You're absolutely right! Then please, by all means, do continue!" The receptionist whipped out a pad of pure white paper. All the paper she had seen before had been much coarser and had other colors mixed in. This must be some high-class stuff here. Was it really all right to use it? Enri began speaking. Although the preamble had been easy enough to talk about, this was the annoying part - the details. Finally, just as Enri's throat was starting to dry out, the conversation finally came to an end.
