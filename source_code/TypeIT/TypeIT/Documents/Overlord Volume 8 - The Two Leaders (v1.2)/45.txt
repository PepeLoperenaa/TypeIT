"It's a pleasure to serve." After waving to the two of them, Kiumei spurred his wolf on and departed. Enri and Paipo watched him enter the slowly-opening village doors. "Then, shall we go back, too?" "Yes, let's." After washing their hands beside the well, Enri and Paipo had just reached home when they heard a young girl's voice. "Welcome back, onee-chan." Along with the voice came the sound of rock grinding against rock. Following the sound to its source, Enri saw Nemu turning a millstone behind the house. A pungent smell came from the millstone. Although it was similar to the smell that had clung to Enri's hands just before, it was several times more intense, enough that one could smell it from some distance away. Nemu was used to the smell, which was all well and good, but Enri's eyes almost teared up as the odor assaulted her. Paipo, standing behind her, seemed unaffected in comparison. It remained to be seen whether that was because the smell only had an effect on certain species, or because it would be terribly rude to make a face like that to his mistress' little sister. "I'm home. How's things? Did you grind it up like I told you?" "Mm, I did. Have a look."
