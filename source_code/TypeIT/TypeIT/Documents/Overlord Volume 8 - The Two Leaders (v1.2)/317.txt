"Uh, but... how do I give this to Cocytus?" There were several mentions across the message to not tell anything to the female guardians and Mare could feel his master's intention of wanting to keep it a secret amongst the male guardians. In this case it would be best for him to hand the message personally. If I keep it a secret and sneak out... it won't be good, right? Because if I'm... uh, do they call it "attention"?

It was the right thing to do since Aura and Mare were both tasked with defending this floor. Mare grasped the magic item hanging around his neck. "S-sis? Can you hear me?" An immediate reply came. I can hear you Mare. What's up? "Ah, that's a relief. Uh, what was it. I need to go visit Cocytus right now. I'll be back soon." To Cocytus? "Yea. I need to hurry."
