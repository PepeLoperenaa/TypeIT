Whetstones helped, of course, but caring for and repairing metal weapons required the services of a professional blacksmith. Which meant that a subtle danger threatened all the goblins. If their equipment deteriorated, it would mean their lives would be in danger. The maintenance of their battle gear was essential. What could she do for them, who had pledged their lives to protect hers? She couldn't just hide in safety and enjoy the fruits of their labour. Just as they had given their all for her, she too had to do everything she could for them. That was Enri's decision. The goblins weren't just Enri's bodyguards, they were the village's protectors. If she decided to press that point, she could probably extort the required money to equip the goblins from the villagers. However, Enri decided to give up on that idea. No matter what, Enri was simply trying to repay the goblins' service through her own efforts. This expedition was the proof of that. "Normally, the safest thing to do would be to confirm the area was free of danger before you went in..." Interrupting from behind was the goblin mage, Dyno. She was an arcane magic caster who wore a humanoid skull for a helmet. In her hands was a staff that was even taller than herself, made of simple, gnarled wood. She dressed in some form of exotic full-body tribal costume that managed to emphasize her meager bust. Her face seemed softer than those of the male goblins. Enri could recognize this because she was their mistress, but normal people probably wouldn't be able to pick up on those details. "However, you can't confirm it's safe, can you?"
