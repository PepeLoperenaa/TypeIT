Using the still-clean back of her hand to wipe off the sweat trickling down her neck, Enri bundled up the weeds she had just finished cutting. The large pile of shredded plant matter gave off the fragrance of freshly-cut grass. Her body was tired from working long hours in the field and the way her sweat-slicked clothes clung to her body made Enri uncomfortable. To lift her mood, Enri stretched herself out. As she did, her eyes swept across the sprawling fields. The wheat they'd planted had grown slowly but steadily, and as the harvest season approached, the wheat would slowly turn golden. Although a wheat field painted gold was a beautiful sight, the weeding work before that was both essential and annoying. If it wasn't done, that golden field would also be a very lonely one. Her labour now was entirely for the sake of the harvest to come. She straightened her body to let her stiff muscles loosen, and to let her tightly-wound body relax. The wind felt refreshingly cool on her skin that had been overheated from long hours of field work. The wind also brought the sound of a commotion from the village to her ears. It sounded like something banging on something, and shouts for getting people to combine their strength as one. These were sounds that had never been heard before in the village. At this moment, the village was working to turn all manner of plans and ideas into reality.
