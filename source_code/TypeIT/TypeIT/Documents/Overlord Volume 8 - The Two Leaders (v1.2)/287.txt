"Aura, can't you do something incredible with your power?" "What do you mean by 'something incredible'? We already talked with each other long time ago to fully figure out the extent of our abilities. Did our Overseer forget that, too?" "Ara... Then how do you normally communicate with Fenrir?" "Normally, I just tell him to do this and that." "But do you not talk with it? If you put in enough effort, can you not do the same with this child?" "Just because I can communicate with the ones I've tamed, don't assume I'd be able to do the same with everyone. Plus I've already tried it. You know Rororo, the hydra that the lizardmen are raising? I can't seem to connect with him." The three looked at each other. "...When in trouble, is Demiurge not the solution?" "Unfortunately, Demiurge's outside Nazarick on Ainz-sama's orders. He's rarely in Nazarick these days. I can still contact him, but I'd rather not unless it's for official business." There were hints of jealousy in Shalltear and Aura's eyes. Demiurge, who was busy helping out the master, was the target of envy and jealousy amongst the guardians.
