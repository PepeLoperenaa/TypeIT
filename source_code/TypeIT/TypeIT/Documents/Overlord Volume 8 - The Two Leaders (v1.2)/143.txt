Just as women would have a crush on strong men, many men were admirers of Momon the Dark Hero, and it could be said that most of the armed forces of E-Rantel were his fans. This soldier was one of them. As a fan of Momon, just being patted on the shoulder by his idol was enough for him to boast about it to everyone he met. As such, he had no intention of upsetting the man he worshiped. "There is that. Well, since Momon-sama vouched for her, I guess it'll be fine." "I think so too. If we treat a friend of Momon-dono poorly, I don't think it'll turn out well. I guess all we can do is avoid rocking the boat. Now then... I guess I'll go back to standing by." "Ayup. I'm heading back to my post too."    Enri drove the wagon with her back to the gate of E-Rantel's city gate, wondering what on earth had just happened. That man in the jet-black armor  the adventurer who had come with Nfirea to Carne Village to pick herbs  he had helped her out of a tight spot. By right, she should have immediately gone to thank him, but unfortunately she'd lost sight of him once she entered the city.
