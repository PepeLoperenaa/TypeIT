After feeling their difference in strength from that small fist, the Naga slowly let Aura slide from his coils. "Aura, time is money, so don't do unnecessary things. Go further away, to a distance where he won't get killed even if he gets dragged in." "Roger!" Aura easily pulled the Naga that was several times heavier than her. After the leg and the muscles that had been cut off had regenerated, Guu finally stand up. Ainz shifted his eyes to it, observing that Guu's physique was still the same. "You are healed. Shall we continue?" Ainz said calmly while resting the staff on his shoulder. He was clearly showing Guu that he didn't plan to defend against him. "You, you, what did you do, do to me? What did you do? Magic?" Guu retreated with his sword in hand while Ainz drew near in pursuit. Ainz had a shorter stride than Guu, so the distance between them was larger than before. "Hmph", Ainz sneered through his nose. "-Huh? How funny. I, who has the cowardly name is advancing, while you, who has the brave name is retreating? Why is that?" Ainz asked in a flat tone, and an answer came from behind.
