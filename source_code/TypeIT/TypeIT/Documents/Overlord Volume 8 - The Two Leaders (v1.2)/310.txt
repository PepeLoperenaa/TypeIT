"Sorry. I don't know why, but Mare said he's preparing to go out. I need to go back just in case." "Is that so? Well... then should we return, as well, Shalltear?" "I have no objection." "I'll finish up with the field before leaving. I also want to talk a little bit with the dryads and the treants." "Then let's disperse for now. Thanks for today. I think I finally learned how to spend holidays. If we get the time again... yea, let's go for a bath together." Part 2 Mare looked away from the book he was reading to check for movement at the gate to the 7th floor. He felt a little feedback of power and placed a bookmark before setting the book down beside the chair. He grabbed the staff beside him; the Divineclass item, 'Shadow of Yggdrasil'. Mare reached for the magic item hanging around his necklace with the other hand but stopped mid-action. There was no need to contact his sister. Since there were no reports of an intruder, the person approaching had to be a comrade. Mare shuffled his way down with small steps as he headed toward the gate.
