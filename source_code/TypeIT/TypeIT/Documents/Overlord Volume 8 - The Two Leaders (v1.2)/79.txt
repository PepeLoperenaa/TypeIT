Unable to read between the lines, the kid gasped in shock, while Enri and Nfirea grinned in response. A reaction like this was only natural from someone who didn't know the full details of the situation. Although the two of them had at least managed to smile at the reaction, others present were not so forgiving. The goblins present could not moderate their rage, and spat utterances like, "that little bastard!" and so on. Enri held out her hands to try and calm them down. This reaction was only natural for a clueless kid, and because he was a kid, it wouldn't do to overreact. "Well, if Ane-san says so... anyway, we should get moving. Who knows what other monsters will be drawn by the scent of blood." "And, although we won... Ane-san. Please don't do this sort of thing again, okay? Our job is protecting you." "What a mess. Still, hearing Enri's voice like that really scared me." "...Well, it's because of that voice that we're fine  oi, brat, you'd better not run off. We have a lot of questions to ask you and if you don't want to go home in pieces you'd better answer up truthfully." "Unlai-san..." "Ane-san, this is for the village's sake too... get over here, kid." The kid got up, slowly and painstakingly. His wounds were healed, so they shouldn't impede his movement, but his stubborn resistance made his movements slow.
