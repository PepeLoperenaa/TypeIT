"Aw, do I have to answer you... hm, well, whatevs. To begin with, if you're being pushed into this position and you know you're going to regret it, then you'd better not take it on to begin with. Think about what kind of things you can and can't handle." The usual carefree girl was gone, and in her place was a haunting, bewitching beauty. The usually wide-open eyes were narrowed, and the inviting smile now sent a chill down her spine. "This is just my opinion anyways; you should probably decide what you want to do on your own. Sit down, chew the cud a little, that sort of thing. For starters, let me put this out here, it doesn't matter if you're the chief or someone else is the chief, you're going to mess up sooner or later. There's only forty-one people I know who'll never make a mistake. 'Cos of that, no point worrying about what happens when you fail. But when you think about it, nobody's better suited to the job than you." "What do you mean?" "Ask the gobs. When the village is attacked by scary monsters and they know they can't win, what happens? Imagine the situation with yourself as the chief and yourself not being the chief." Lupusregina's expression changed again, back to her cheerful self. "Welp, that's about it. Haaa, I don't want to play counsellor at all. Then again if En-chan didn't become the chief, the beautiful tragedy would unfold and it would be more fun."
