"The village?" Foire tilted her head, which made her short hair scrape against Lumiere's face. Resisting the urge to sneeze, Lumiere pushed Foire away before facing toward Lupusregina. "Lupusregina-san, you work outside, right?" "Yup, in the human village." "The human village, huh... it must be tough." Lumiere looked at Lupusregina with sympathetic eyes. "Nah, it's nothing like that! Since Ainz-sama ordered it, it's worth doing! ...Although, I have to say, it's kind of boring. How should I put this... it would be so much more fun to squish them beneath my feet." Sixth has no particular reaction to that statement. Humans and their villages and whatnot were unimportant to her. Whether they prospered or were destroyed, the only thing that mattered was if they were useful to Nazarick. "Even if Ainz-sama says that village has value, I still can't see it" "Did Ainz-sama say that out of compassion for those worthless people in the village?" "No, no, isn't Ainz-sama like a hurricane of death? I'm sure he'll grind them into dust when he feels like it."
