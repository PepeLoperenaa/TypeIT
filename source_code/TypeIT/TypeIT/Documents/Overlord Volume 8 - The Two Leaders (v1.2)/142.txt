"Then, another question. That Enri Emmot girl. Do you really think she's just a village girl?" "Certainly not. There's no way she could be a simple village girl, otherwise why would a great hero like him help her? And it wasn't a coincidence she was carrying that item... Could it have something to do with the Theocracy?" "That Ainz Somethingorother fellow. If he's from the Theocracy, shouldn't we let the brass know?" "Frankly speaking, I don't know. After all, Momon-dono already vouched for her. If we let the people on top know... well, you would be just doing your job, but do you really want to upset Momon-dono?" The soldier's face twisted. The exploits of Momon the Dark Hero in the graveyards of E-Rantel were a common conversation topic when the soldiers gathered. There was nobody whose blood wouldn't be boiling after hearing the legend of how a hero destroyed a horde of tens of thousands of undead. Even those who simply watched from afar could feel the overwhelming pressure of his heroic swordplay. The man who could make a mighty magical beast kneel before him and offer to serve as his mount set the soldiers' hearts ablaze.
