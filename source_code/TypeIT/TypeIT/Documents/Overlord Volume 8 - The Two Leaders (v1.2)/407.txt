"Muu!?" After retreating a few steps, Guu looked at the sword in his hand, and then at Ainz. He then turned his back to his foe and walked to the other giants. In the next moment, the sword struck his troll subordinate. The sword cleaved in through the shoulder and split the troll easily, spraying blood everywhere. With a loud, stupid sound, the giant roared in pain. Seeing the state his subordinate was in, Guu nodded his head in satisfaction, confirming that there was nothing wrong with the weapon. "I see, this is the regenerative power of trolls. It is really surprising to see it in action." The open wound healed swiftly, just like watching a video in reverse. He did that because he knew about his fellow troll's ability, but Guu had a sinister face, as if he was ready to inflict another wound onto his subordinate on the floor. "Deciding the fate of the weak is the privilege of the strong. However, I am... very unhappy." Ainz stepped forward, no longer in the mood to play. Guu gripped his sword tightly with both hands, waiting for the slowly advancing Ainz. "Guu! This fellow, Ainz Ooal Gown is too unnatural! We have to work together to defeat-" "Shut up! Just watch from there, coward! -Guoohhh!"
