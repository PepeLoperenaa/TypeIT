Everyone was well-geared, but they carried little baggage. That was because the plan was to swiftly complete their work, and not to mount a long expedition in the forest. Not everyone in the troop was assigned to Enri's protection. Their objective was to thoroughly scout the surrounding area and further verify the information the goblin wolf riders had collected. That is to say, they were to carefully observe the current situation within the Great Forest. In order to protect the village, the goblins had decided to scout its surroundings and the hinterlands. Only three goblins would accompany Enri. Them, and one more person: Nfirea. He had made his preparations too, dressed in suitable clothing for collecting herbs in a forest. With Nfirea around, the herb harvesting trip would definitely be a success. Perhaps he had sensed Enri looking at him, and turned around, asking "What's the matter?" Although Enri had waved her hands as though to say "nothing, nothing," one of the surrounding goblins took notice and drew closer to Enri's side. He was a goblin whose body was so muscular and athletic that it would be hard for bystanders to think that he was a goblin. His torso was protected by a crude, but practical breastplate, and the greatsword he used was sheathed on his back. This was Jugem, the leader of the goblins, named after a fairytale goblin ranger called 'Jugem Juugem' by Enri. As an aside, there were other named knights who did battle alongside the goblin ranger, and their names were also used for the other goblins. "There shouldn't be anything wrong... what's the matter?"
