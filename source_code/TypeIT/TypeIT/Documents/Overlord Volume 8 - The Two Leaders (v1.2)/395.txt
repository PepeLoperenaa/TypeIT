"Haha, that makes me glad." The pleasantries of Aura the child made Ainz happy. For Ainz, who loved the NPCs like his own children, he would naturally smile when he hear them say they liked him. "So, who does Ainz-sama like the most? Albedo or Shalltear?" "Haha. Well, I like Aura a lot." "-Eh?" Ainz patted Aura's head from behind, ruffling her hair through his fingers. "-Ehhh!?" Should I think about Sex Ed for the children? If there is a school for dark elves, sending Aura and Mare there will allow them to grow right? What would Bukubukuchagama do if she was here? Speaking of schools... Campus love comedy... That's what Peroroncino-san screamed at Slathan-san to make Nazarick Academy together. Where did that data go? "-Ehhhhhhhhhhh!!" "What is it Aura, that was loud." "Ah! I-I am sorry. Doing that so near the Giant of the East's territory..." "It's fine, no need to apologize. It is a matter for the future anyway-"
