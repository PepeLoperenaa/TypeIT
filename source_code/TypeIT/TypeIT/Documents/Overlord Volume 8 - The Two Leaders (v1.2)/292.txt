Albedo glanced at Aura before swaying her head. If Aura was experienced, it would have been a problem. "Shalltear, what about you?" "...I have no experience with the opposite gender. But if you are talking about experience with the same gender..." Aura tilted her head as if she did not understand for a second before realizing what it meant and made an 'Uwaaaah' sound while frowning. "But! There are no suitable men around. I prefer the dead ones, but rotting ones are too much... right?! Right?!" "Even if you want our approval, it's too much for us to accept your weird fetishes, Shalltear." All three lowered their gaze to the ground along with a silent agreement not to talk further on the subject. "Well... I understand why I can't ride the bicorn... but this is nonsense. What do I do..." Albedo frowned in unhappiness. The bicorn shuddered as though it had been scolded as well. "Mmm... It's like a part of Albedo's abilities are sealed now."
