"-Wahh, don't look over here while grabbing your head. Disgusting. Shalltear, aren't you going to brush your teeth?" "-I can do that in my room, no need to do it here. Anyway, can we even get cavities?" "-Even if you don't have cavities, if you have bad breath while kissing, even a thousand year-old love will turn cold." The sound of the brush stopped and heavy footsteps could be heard. "-Hmm, wait, are you going in like this? At least..." After a loud splash, sound of water flowing down could be heard. Someone seemed to have boldly leaped into the pool. "-Wah! Cough cough! If I were a vampire from the storybooks, I would have sunk and not gotten up!" "-You are not a kid, don't jump in!" "-Fufufu. Ah...How relaxing. That's why I came here." "-At least follow bathing etiquette... Oh?" "-What? Hmm? The lion is moving?" "-To not know the etiquette means you have no right to enter the bath! Exterminate!"
