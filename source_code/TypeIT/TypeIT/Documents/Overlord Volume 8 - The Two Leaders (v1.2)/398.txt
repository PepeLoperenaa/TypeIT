Ainz followed Aura as they moved into the cavern near the clearing. Glancing ahead, he could see that the slope at the entrance was slight and the space within was rather small. The ceiling was high, which allowed huge creatures to move freely. ... This reminds me of a dungeon exploration during my gaming days. When I found a cave in the mountains, I would get excited and wonder what was inside. Back then, the one leading the way would be Tigris Euphrates, Ainz- or rather, Momonga would follow behind. Momonga would summon undead to support them. These undead would be sent ahead of the party to trigger traps, in what was called a "warrior's disarm" or "summon disarm". How nostalgic... Ainz who was reminiscing the past walked briskly, but his good mood only lasted several seconds. The stench coming from below made Ainz frown- even though he didn't have brows. It wasn't the pungent smell of gas, but that of decomposing animal fat. Is this a trap to conceal the smell of gas with that of rot? Can the dumb beings living in caves make such an elaborate trap... This is probably a coincidence. Ainz was an undead that did not need to breathe and had absolute resistance against such airborne attacks. Aura was protected by magic items that would block the effects of the stench if it was an attack. Hence, this place simply smelled bad. "The Giant of the East does not seem to be a hygienic creature. It would be great if it is intelligent enough to converse with."
