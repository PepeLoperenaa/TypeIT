"I'll have a Hyueri water, then." "Hyueri juice for me too" "Got it. How about Ane-san?" "I think I'll have the Hyueri water too. And... how about washing hands? Even if our noses are used to it..." "Ah, that should be all right. Oi, kid- I mean, Agu, you come over here too. Gotta clean yourself up. And bro, sorry about this, but you mind putting away our dirty weapons?" "Is it alright?" "Of course it is. Not like he can do anything. Our rules here are very simple." "If that's the case... let's go." Kaijali left the room with three sets of weapons. "Agu, come over here quickly." "Why do I have to wash? Will it make me pretty?" Enri noticed that Agu's hands were very dirty; there weren't clean by any definition of the word. "Your opinion is irrelevant. This is the owner of the house telling you to wash up. Or are you saying you're going to defy the owner in his own house?"
