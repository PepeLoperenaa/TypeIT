Agu thought of Enri. Looking at it calmly, she'd been able to give forceful, effective orders. Maybe that was just the tip of the iceberg? "Ane-san just pretends to be weak. If she hears anything funny about you, she'll crush you to death with one hand. After that, cleanup will be a pain. There'll be blood everywhere." "Is, is that so... then why, why does she have to pretend to be weak? If she were strong, wouldn't there be fewer problems?" "If you show off your strength, some fool will immediately come and challenge you. Won't that cause its fair share of trouble as well?" Agu had thought that strength was the solution to all problems, but that was not the case. Locked in a labyrinth of self-reflection, he didn't realise that the adult goblin in front of him had a playful expression on his face.    In the middle of the night, Enri suddenly woke from sleep. Though there didn't seem to be anything around, Enri remained still while she moved her eyes to check around her. The world before her was pitch black, lit only by a slim ray of moonlight from between the window shutters. She couldn't see anything strange in this weak light. But Enri's ears could hear just fine. There were no sounds of horses neighing, armored knights clanking, or people screaming. It was just a normal night. Enri sighed softly, and closed her eyes. She'd been fast asleep, so she was still groggy and couldn't get up right away.
