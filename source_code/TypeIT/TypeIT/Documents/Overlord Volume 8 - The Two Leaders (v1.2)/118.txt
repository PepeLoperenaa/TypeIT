Just as Enri was about to drop out of Boss Mode from fatigue, Jugem helped her out. "Wonderful! Looks like Ane-san spared your lives!" The strength had visibly ebbed from the ogres' bodies. Given that they could be killed at any moment, that was a natural reaction. One ogre looked at Enri and spoke. "Boss, Chief, we, what do?" That, she hadn't thought about. Still, what she didn't know, she could entrust to someone else. "Jugem, I'll let you take care of them. Use them as you see fit." "Got it, Ane-san." The goblin leader bowed to Enri, then turned back to the ogres. "Well then. First of all, we're going to pitch tents outside the village. You lot will be shacking up there. And you too, help them with the tents." The ogres left, accompanied by the goblins. "Pitching tents outside the village will be a problem; we'll need to find them a place to live in the village. Even so, we need to wait till they learn not to attack the villagers first." "I'll need to go around to talk with a lot of people to make them accept it."
