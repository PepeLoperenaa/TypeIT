Lumiere counted off the days on her fingers. The rooms of the Supreme Beings of Nazarick were massive in scale, so much so that one person needed half a day or more to clean one of them carefully. By numbers alone, it was possible for the maids to clean them all on a daily basis, even with Albedo's spare room factored in, but that would require a lot of people to work all day without any rest. However, this was not a problem to the maids. They had been created by the Supreme Beings of Nazarick; it was only fitting that they should work their fingers to the bone for them in devout reverence. And then, these fanatical workers had been told to stop by their god, Ainz Ooal Gown. Ainz knew the hardships of working under unethical companies, and he could not bear to let these girls, who were like his friends' daughters, suffer like that. He had told them, "Don't clean the unused rooms so frequently", and then "You will be grouped into teams for shifts." Thus, the regular maids of Nazarick were organized into two shifts; the day shift and the night shift. The former had thirty people and the latter had ten, while the one remaining person got the day off. After calculating the working days for the maids, the announcement that they would have a break every forty-one days was met with complaint. It was not that there were too few days off, but the opposite. They protested the need to have a day off at all.
