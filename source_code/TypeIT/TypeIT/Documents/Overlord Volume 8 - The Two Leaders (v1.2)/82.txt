"That's right. It's a scary new place in the Great Forest. Anyone who goes near it will perish. They say there's undead there too." "You say everyone who goes near it will die, but you sure know a lot about it." "...while the Monument of Destruction was still under construction, the brave ones from our tribe went there and saw skeleton monsters building it." "Did you know about this?" "No, I'm sorry, but this is new to us too. If we go too deep into the forest we might meet enemies even our boss can't defeat. So we try not to go too far." "...Hey, which tribe are you three from? You're stronger than any goblins I've ever seen before, so where" Agu sneaked a glance at Enri, and then mumbled something about 'Usually humans are...' to himself. "Do you serve the humans?" "Is that weird? Isn't it normal to work for someone who's strong?" "But strong people... no, I mean, I've heard that humans as a race have strong members and weak members... but you're a woman, right? And the one with his hair covering his face is a man, right?" Enri got an answer she could accept from Nfirea, who was muttering beside her.
