"So, what did she say?" "She first wants me to convey her thanks to Momon-san. She had three objectives. First was to sell the herbs she gathered, the second was to check if anyone at the temple wanted to immigrate and the third was to go to the Adventurer's Guild." "Adventurer's Guild? What kind of quest is she trying to put in?" "I'm sorry, I didn't ask her that. Should I find her and beat her until she spills the beans?" "No, don't do that. We need to go to the Adventurer's Guild anyways. We should be able to find out through the guild." It was probably not something like wanting to thank Ainz Ooal Gown directly. If that was the case, Lupusregina visited the village regularly- "Speaking of which, Nabe. Did you receive any special report from Lupusregina?" Ainz frowned -even though he did not have any skin on his face- when he saw Narberal shake her head. Originally, he had stationed the Shadow Demons at Carne Village, but for the purpose of building a good relationship with them, he had sent Lupusregina instead. He had ordered her to send a report if any problem occurred, but there was not any report so far. So he decided there was nothing problematic happening over at Carne village thus far. There would not have been a need to report that Enri went to E-Rantel alone, but uneasiness sprouted like clouds deep inside Ainz. "I thought of Lupusregina as a hard worker. What do you think, Narberal?"
