Without Enfi, I probably would have ignored it completely. As expected of Enfi." "Really now, Ani-san's pretty amazing. Is it worth a lot?" "It's worth quite a bit of money... ah, wait. Don't pick it. What Enri and I are aiming for is worth even more. If we can't find it, then we'll pick this on the way back." "I see. Yeah, we got it. Speaking of which, to Ani-san, this forest must be like a treasure trove, since it's so easy to make wealth. Ah with Ani-san I feel much more at ease."

I'm pretty confident of that." "Mmm. Enfi can definitely do that." An awkward mood flowed through the sleeping forest. "Then, Ane-san, is that all?" "Hm? Kaijali-san, what do you mean?"
