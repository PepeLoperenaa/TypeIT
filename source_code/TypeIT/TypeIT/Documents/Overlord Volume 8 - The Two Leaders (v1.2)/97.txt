"That's right. I also heard that the master of the Monument of Destruction can command the undead, little black shadows that can move through darkness. That's what the survivors told us." Everyone  with the exception of Lupusregina  looked uneasily at each other. The first thing was the Beast of the South. Since its territory was supposed to be nearby, then it must surely be the magical beast tamed by the adventurers who had escorted Nfirea here - or more specifically, the one who wore jet-black plate armor. It certainly had the look of power and strength about it, and so the description fit it perfectly. "The Beast... the Wise King of the Forest, Hamsuke-san." "That's it! Ahh, yes, that's the Beast..." As he heard Nfirea, Brita, who had not moved to the village at that time, made a sound. According to her, she had seen it in E-Rantel, from far away. And there were two more monstrous creatures out there who could equal it. Nobody could not feel shock and fear at that realisation. "Then, how did you escape?" "Until recently, the three of them held each other in check. The Beast of the South didn't leave its territory, but nobody could guarantee that would always be the case. If the East and West fought, no matter who won, there was always the chance that in their moment of victory, they would be finished off by the Beast in their weakened state. As such, none of the three powers actually engaged in battle."
