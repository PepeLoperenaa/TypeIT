"Hm? No, I actually, nothing... ah... come to think of it, there's a question I forgot to ask. What sort of herbs are you looking for?" "We didn't tell you? It's a herb called Enkaishi. Afterwards we'll let Nemu grind it up." "Ah, so that's what it is. Got it. Although, even if you describe it to us, we won't be able to tell the difference. Then, let's move on." Step by step, they ventured further into the forest. As they went on, their noses started itching from the thick scent of the forest's fragrance. There was no sign of human activity here at all. Immersed in this place, Nfirea felt like this was a world where humans were weak and tiny. Then, he opened his mouth to speak. "Let's start looking around here. We're looking for places with lots of shade and humidity... are there any water sources nearby? That herb grows near them. There's no sign of monster activity around here, what a stroke of luck." With his vast experience as a herbalist, it was unlikely for Nfirea to make a mistake.. The goblins and Enri replied in approval. The group put their things down and the burden on them decreased greatly. "Ahhh... Ane-san, could you go give Ani-san a hand?" "Ah, yes, that's right. Enfi must have his hands full by himself." Enri walked over to where Nfirea had put down his luggage and assisted him in his labors.
