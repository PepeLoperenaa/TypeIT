Ainz stared at the Naga whose head was almost on the ground, and shrugged nonchalantly. "...Well, anything is fine. The reason I came was for negotiation after all." "How, how frightening. My lord, you must think that it's fine whatever happens to this old one. My lord must regard this old one who rules the western forest on the same level as rolling stones." "No, I am slightly more interested than that. You mentioned something about dark elves right? Tell me the details." "Of course... Certainly. This old one will tell everything it knows! But, erm..." Ainz waved for it to continue, and the Naga said: "Could you spare this old one's life after that?" "I promise you this. If you swear fealty to me and work hard, I will reward you for your efforts... Speaking of which, where are your subordinates? Are you like Hamsuke, no, the monster that ruled the southern forest, who controlled the west alone?" "No, this old one has subordinates. I did not bring them along for the negotiation with Guu. If negotiations broke down, they would not be able to escape with invisibility." "I see, then next question. Are there any trolls working for you?" "Just one."
