All the soldiers who spotted Ainz shouted out in surprise. In E-Rantel, there was not a single person who did not know of the adamantite-ranked adventurer, Momon. Ainz put special care into appearing confident as he approached the checkpoint. Inside was an agitated magic caster, a soldier and a country girl sitting on a chair. "We want to enter the city as quickly as possible... but what's the matter?" "Uwaaah!" The two men screamed out in surprise like the soldiers on the outside and the country girl looked over in his direction with a stupefied expression. "M-Momon-sama! I apologize!" "What are you... Hm? She's..." It was a familiar face. He felt as if he had seen her before and he racked his brain -even though he did not have one- for information about her. "Yes! We were investigating this suspicious girl, so it took some time. We apologize for inconveniencing you, Momon-sama-" Ainz remembered the girl's name while thinking that the man's voice was distracting. "-Enri. Yeah, you're Enri Emmot, correct?"
