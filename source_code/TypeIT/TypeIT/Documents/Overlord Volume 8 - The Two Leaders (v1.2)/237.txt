"Owie" "You idiot. How could you be so rude? Everyone, I apologize on her behalf." After pulling Lupusregina back, the woman in the back bowed to them. "I am Ainz-sama's maid, Yuri Alpha. I am here to receive Nfirea-sama, Enrisama and Nemu-sama. Will you permit us entry?" "Ah, yes. Please come in, Lupusregina too." The woman who had entered with Lupusregina had an otherworldly beauty, just like Lupusregina. "Then, once you're ready, we can begin the teleportation straight away." "Te-teleportation? You can teleport?!" Nfirea was practically shouting. Although Enri didn't know why Nfirea was so surprised, she could guess that it was a big deal. Was teleporting the Warrior-Chief and the others a big deal too? "Ah, no. This is not my power, but the power of a magic item Ainz-sama gave me."
