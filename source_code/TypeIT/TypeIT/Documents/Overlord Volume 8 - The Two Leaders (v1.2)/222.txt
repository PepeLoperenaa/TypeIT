"Come on, big guy, I'll play with you! Come have a go if you're hard enough! Acid Arrow!" Nfirea kept taunting the troll, while firing a green arrow of acid at it. As it hit, steam rose with the sound of hissing and bubbling, making the troll scream in agony. The troll fixed its rage-maddened eyes on Nfirea. It paid no more attention to Enri. "Go! Go and get help!" It would be foolish to waste time here. "You'd better stay safe!" Saying that, Enri ran. The troll didn't look like it wanted to follow. Frankly speaking, his chances of survival were zero. There was an overwhelming difference in their respective physical capabilities. And there was no way he could triumph over a foe that needed gold-ranked adventurers to beat. It was a hopeless battle, and being able to hold on for even a minute was worthy of praise.
