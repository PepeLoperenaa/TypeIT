Did you make this, Gown-sama?" "Hahaha, yes, that's right. My friends and I did." "That's amazing! Gown-sama and Gown-sama's friends are all amazing!" "Hah! Hahahaha!" The clear and bright laughter reverberated through the hallway. By this time, Nfirea and Enri had hesitantly reached the two of them. Enri tightly gripped Nemu's hand, infused with a will that would never let go. "We thank you for your kind invitation from the bottom of our hearts!" "There is no need for such formality. We are here to celebrate the production of your new potion. Be at ease." "Gown-sama, I am truly sorry. My sister Nemu has been rude to you."
