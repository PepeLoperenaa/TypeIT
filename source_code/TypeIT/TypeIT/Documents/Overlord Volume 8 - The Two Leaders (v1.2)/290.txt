But a considerable amount of records had been erased from it. It was as if Peroroncino had been afraid of someone reading everything that was written on there. The item did not have much use, but Shalltear did not care for any of that. For her, it was more important to have an item that her creator once used. "B... bi... bico..." Shalltear kept turning the pages while murmuring. Albedo and Aura tried to peek from the side, but Shalltear stepped back with her book and glared sharply at both of them. "Hmph. Well, it doesn't matter. I got a bracelet from Ainz-sama anyways." Aura gently ran her finger along the silver band on her wrist and Albedo did the same to the ring on her left pinkie finger. But there were other people who had received the ring other than her. I want to receive something special just for me. A special item from Ainzsama... Just as Albedo was gently rubbing her lower abdomen, Shalltear spoke out. It appeared that she had found the page she was looking for. "Bicorn! Found it, now..." Shalltear suddenly stopped moving and looked at Albedo with a surprised expression. Then she looked at the book again.
