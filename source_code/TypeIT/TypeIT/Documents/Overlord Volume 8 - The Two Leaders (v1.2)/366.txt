Ainz spoke in a tone that he thought sounded very insightful. "There's no need to worry about it. I know very well what kind of person she is. She's definitely not someone who would cause trouble, so please let her go. Can you do that?" "Of course. If it's an acquaintance of Momon from 'Darkness', even a criminal would be able to enter the city freely if you vouched for them." "Is that so. Then, I'm sorry to ask this of you, but please let her in. And I apologize once again, but can you let us, 'Darkness', in as well?"    Ainz returned to Narberal and Hamsuke with the permit. "I have the permit. Let's go in." He passed by those standing while riding on top of Hamsuke. He had grabbed the attention of those waiting, but after they spotted the black armour, giant swords, Hamsuke and Narberal, they looked away, as though they had accepted it. They were keenly aware of the clear difference in status between them and Ainz. He entered E-Rantel while receiving deep, respectful bows from the soldiers. "Nabe, I have something to request of you." "I stand ready to receive any command."
