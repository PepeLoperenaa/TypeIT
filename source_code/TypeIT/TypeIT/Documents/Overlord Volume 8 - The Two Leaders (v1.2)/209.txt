"...Oi, you lot. Afterwards, every single one of us is going to die. Don't even think about childish things like falling back. Make sure you brand your heroic deaths into everyone's eyes!" The goblins answered with a roar full of fighting spirit. In an instant, enemies and allies alike seemed to freeze. "Here we go, lads! Let's show them the power of Ane-san's boys!"    After a circuit of the village, Enri confirmed that nobody was left behind and breathed a sigh of relief. Just then, the sound of something breaking came from the front. It was followed by battle cries from both sides and the resounding deep bass sound made her shudder. That was probably the sound of the gate breaking and the goblins joining battle. She nearly threw up from stress, but Enri forced it back down. The bitter taste remained in her mouth, but she ignored it to look at Nfirea. "Enfi. We should be heading to the gate." "Understood. But you need to go to the rendezvous point and calm everyone down, okay?" Enfi's words had the subtext of don't get in everyone else's way.
