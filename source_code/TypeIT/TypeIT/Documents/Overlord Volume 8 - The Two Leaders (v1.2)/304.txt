Someone objected before Albedo could answer. "Ahahaha, Shalltear, that's a good joke. Of course, because the 6th floor is so wide, it would be obvious for you to think it'd be hard to find an intruder. If they manage to escape the colosseum... and scatter in every direction like baby spiders, it might get annoying if there's a lot of them." Aura's laughs were empty and her gazes were icy. "But aren't you underestimating me? This is my hunting ground. Whether they scatter or not, I can immediately hunt them down. Even if they plan on harming Ainz-sama and somehow manage to escape this floor, they'd still need to get past Guren's area on the 7th floor, and they won't be able to survive even a single step on the 8th floor. If they do decide to run away, they'd need to tread through the dark waters of the 4th floor and your area... Do you really think that's possible?" Shalltear shook her head. "It would be impossible." "So that's why it doesn't really matter if there're a lot of newcomers on this floor. You don't need to worry about it." "Aura already said everything I wanted to say. The plan is to gather all the new monsters here, or so it's being discussed." "Huh? Not just the plant-type monsters?" Aura asked in surprise and Albedo simply smiled.
