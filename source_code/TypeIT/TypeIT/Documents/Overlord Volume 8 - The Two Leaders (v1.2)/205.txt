"Breathe deep! In  out! In  Pull!" This voice was just like their training, and for a moment, the defense force archers forgot they were on the battlefield. Ignoring the sound of the timbers creaking, they performed the same movements like they did during practice. "Loose!"

"Amazing," Agu muttered to himself, but Jugem had no intention of giving anyone else the time to watch further. "Second wave ready!  Don't panic  Breathe deep! In  out! In  Pull!" By this time, Shuringan and Gurindai had been healed and took their places by the defence force. "Loose!" Once again, fourteen arrows flew forth, followed slightly later by two more. The door creaked louder as the cries from the enemy intensified. The arrows must have gotten them mad - and made them hit harder. "Back up! Change weapons!"
