"Repaying good with good and evil with evil. This is the norm of the world." A cruel smile appeared on Ainz' face. He was feeling the exhilaration of the possibility of conducting more experiments if he captured a player. The experiment he didn't carry out because it was too scary- death, would be the first test he would run. "An. Eye. For. An. Eye. And. A. Tooth. For. A. Tooth. Right?" "That's true, but did you know? That saying also means that one shouldn't go too far in seeking revenge. However, I intend to exact payback far beyond what they did to us." That's what Punitto Moe would say, Ainz uttered in his heart. "Ohhhh! As. Expected. Of. Ainz-sama. Excelling. In. Both. Might. And. Intellect." Without needing to turn his head, Ainz could feel the respect directed at him from his back. "Is. Ainz-sama. Planning. To. Spend. The. Entire. Day. Inside. Nazarick?" "No, after the bath, I will go through the work on hand and then return to ERantel. There are plenty of matters requiring my attention there too. What about you?" "I. Will. Return. To. The. Guard. Post. Inside. Nazarick. For. The. Time. Being. The. Exploration. Of. The. Area. Surrounding. The. Lake. And. Other. Matters. That. Will. Benefit. Nazarick. Have. Almost. Been. Completed."
