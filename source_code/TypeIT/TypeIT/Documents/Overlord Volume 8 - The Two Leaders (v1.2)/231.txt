Enri let the strength flow from her arms, and at the same time Nfirea loosened his grip. Feeling slightly disappointed, they both turned to Lupusregina. "The troll" Shifting her line of sight, Enri saw something which was hard to describe. "Ah, this? Kinda looks like a hamburger patty, doesn't it? All it needs is a good charbroiling." A mass of blood-spattered meat shifted and twitched under the bloodied head of Lupus' crozier. There was nothing about the pile of broken flesh that suggested that it had once been a troll. However, what made it disgusting was the fact that it was still regenerating, and still breathing. "Ahhh well it's good you two are fine. Then I guess I can clean things up here too." Enri heard the voices of the goblins approaching. It seemed like the battle for the main gate had been won. "There you go" Fire descended from the heavens, and a pillar of red light engulfed the troll, producing the stench of cooked meat.
