"Oya? Hm, I definitely recall saying something like thatsu" "..." "...Ah! I hope Beta-san can hand this potion to Gown-sama. It's newly developed, but its effects have been tested and proven." "...Oh? Enfi-chan finally made it?" "That's right. Unfortunately, it's not completely red, but I think we've made significant progress." " Well, that's great. I'm sure Ainz-sama will be very happy to hear it." With that, Lupusregina's attitude seemed to have become that of a normal person, and not the flighty, carefree girl from before. However, that expression only lasted a moment. In the next, she was back to her old self. "Ahhhh, how exciting- Really, I picked a great day to visitsu. Also, no need to call me Beta. Lupusregina will do -su. Just for you" With the (apparently) high-spirited Lupusregina in tow, they entered the village gates. The villagers didn't say anything when they saw the unfamiliar goblin child. One could say that they weren't nervous, but it could also be said that they trusted Enri. She might have become something like family to the goblins who protected the village. They went through the village and past Enri's home. Their destination was the goblin's house. "Excuse me for a bit. I'm going to call Brita-san over to listen to what Agu has to say."
