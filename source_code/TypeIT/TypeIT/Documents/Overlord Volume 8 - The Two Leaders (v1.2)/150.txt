The place was filled with a heat and activity that made Enri unsteady on her feet, a world of unrelenting scrutiny and tension. This was the world of adventurers. Enri's mouth dropped open as she beheld a sight she would never see in her village, then hurriedly shut it back up. It was true that she hailed from the boondocks, and it was no surprise that she'd be startled by the mood of the big city, but for a girl her age, staring dumbly with her mouth agape was just shameful. Enri set out, her back ramrod straight, consciously checking her movements so that she wouldn't move the arms and legs on the same side or do anything which would make her a laughingstock. However, Enri started to have her doubts about whether it was all right for an obviously out-of-place village girl to be strolling so boldly amongst the muscular adventurers. At the counter, she was welcomed by the receptionist's smile. "Welcome." "Y-yes, I'm here to visit." Enri locked eyes with the receptionist. Following which, the two of them smiled faintly. Enri felt her shoulders relax, for what might have been the first time since she came to E-Rantel. "Then, may I ask what business you have with the Adventurer's Guild?"
