However, the chief seemed to have anticipated this, because there was no regret on his face, only calm acceptance. "So that's how it is. Well, it can't be helped. We're a frontier village, so people won't want to move where the monster appearance rates are high." The village chief said what Enri had been thinking. It might have well been what everyone in the village had already accepted. "You've done a lot for us. Thank you." The chief lowered his head, and Enri said, "It's all right," in return. It had been confusing at times, but it had also been a good experience. "Then" the chief's line of sight flickered to Gokoh for a second. "There is one thing I would like to entrust to Enri Emmot." "Ah, yes. What is it? You're being so serious, Chief..." "...I hope you will carry on in my position as village chief."
