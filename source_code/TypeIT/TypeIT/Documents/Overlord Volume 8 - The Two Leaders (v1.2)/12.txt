Nemu woke from the sound of Enri making breakfast and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes. "Morning, onee-chan. Let me help too!" "Morning, Nemu. I'm good over here, but there's still that thing I asked you to help me take care of yesterday..." Unhappiness flashed over Nemu's face for a moment, but in the end, she didn't complain, although she did droop her head and replied "'kay" as she followed Enri's request. Enri stopped halfway through the cutting. Her heart ached. Nemu was ten years old now, and she had been a lively and spirited girl once. After that incident, the formerly naive and carefree Nemu became slavishly obedient to her sister, without any of the playfulness or tantrums of children her age. She was a good girl now - so good that it hurt. The smiling faces of her parents appeared in Enri's mind. Although several months had passed, the wounds from that incident had not yet healed. If they had died because of illness, she could have prepared herself for it. If they had died from an accident or a natural disaster, she wouldn't have hated anyone else for it, and maybe she would not have been scarred either. But her parents had been murdered in front of her eyes, and her heart was now filled with resentment. There was no way she could feel otherwise. Enri squeezed her eyes shut. If there was someone nearby, then she could work hard so they would not see her weakness. But when she was by herself, the loneliness reopened the wounds in her heart.
