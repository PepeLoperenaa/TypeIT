"Ah- yeah, it kind of makes sense, Agu's the son of his tribe's chief. He must feel like he has a duty to protect them or something. Really, he's just a kid but he's acting like a man" Although Lupusregina was just smiling lightly, anyone who saw it would be captivated by the charm radiating from her. Even Enri found herself looking longingly at her despite the fact that they were both women. "Aiya, shouldn't you be watching your front instead?" "That, that's right!" Enri, blushing to the tips of her ears, hastily looked to her front once more. After stopping in front of the chief's house, Enri and Gokoh got off the wagon. "Then, I'll bring the horse back to the stables. Don't feel like disturbing you guys. Let me know what you guys talked about later" "I understand. Then, I'm sorry for imposing, but we're counting on you." Enri bowed to Lupusregina, who smiled with a "hoho" and drove the wagon off. Enri knocked on the door, announced herself loudly enough for everyone inside to hear, and opened the door.
