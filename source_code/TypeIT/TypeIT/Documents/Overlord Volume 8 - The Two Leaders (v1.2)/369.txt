"It is as you say. It might be easy to think of her as insincere due to her way of speaking, but it's an act. She is an excellent maid who is brutal and cunning." Calling someone brutal and cunning was hardly a compliment. Ainz glanced over at Nabe's face to make sure it was not something she said because she did not hold Lupusregina in high regard, but saw only respect and admiration. "Then is it alright to head to the Adventurer's Guild, my lord?" "Of course. You know the place, right? Then Nabe, hop on behind. There's no need to take out "Statue of Animal: Warhorse" again." As soon as Ainz grabbed Narberal's hand and pulled her up, Hamsuke launched forward as if she had been waiting for it. Ainz no longer felt ashamed of riding Hamsuke around the city. He rather liked how he could talk and give commands to it. It felt like a taxi. The Adventurer's Guild came into view, as well as the sight of Enri entering with her cart. "...Guess it can't be helped. We'll use the back door. Hamsuke, go around the back." "As you command, my lord!" Normally, adventurers were not allowed to use the back door, but adamantite adventurers were allowed to do pretty much anything they pleased. It was still the first time he used the back door though. Excessively using his privileges just because he was special would only tarnish his reputation.
