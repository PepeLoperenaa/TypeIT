"From the lower floor? Demiurge's out right now... Maybe it's one of his subordinates? Are you sure it's okay not to check?" "Mmm- Mare's there, so it should be fine. If there's a problem, he'll contact me." Aura touched the earring piece on her necklace. "It's not something special either. If someone wants to get to the surface from lower floors, they'd need to go through the gate on each floor at specific points. Speaking of which, we have someone who uses magic so they don't have to run, right?" "Eh-hem! The Great Tomb of Nazarick truly is an impregnable fortress." "Yea, even if someone uses the super-tier magic 'Sword of Damocles' or the World-class item I possess, they wouldn't be able to destroy an entire floor. That's why you must never lose the ring which allows you to teleport anywhere at will." Everyone looked at the ring on Albedo's left pinkie finger. "That's right. When Mare goes outside, he always puts it somewhere safe. Thinking about it this way, I can comprehend the importance of that ring- Ah! Mare contacted me." Aura put some distance between herself and the group before she grasped the earring and started talking to Mare. Aura slowly frowned and by the time the conversation was over, her expression was quite dark.
