The construction of fish farms were being carried out at extreme speed, and there were currently three gigantic fish farms, with this one, the fourth, on the way. "But you can't start farming them while they're hatchlings, right?" "Yes. Our - no - my younger brother's knowledge only relates to raising the fish that were somewhat grown already. But Demiurge-sama taught us the basics, so we're also preparing the fish farm for the hatchlings as well. I predict that within few years, we'll have doubled the food supply just from the fish farm." "I-is that so. In a few years, we won't need to bring in any fish from Nazarick. And of course, you'll always be able to get them during an emergency." "We are all grateful to Ainz-sama from the bottom of our hearts. It was because he gave us so many fish... Speaking of which, the fish we received had no organs. How did they live? Are they creatures that don't need food, like some monsters? No, considering they don't have any bones as well..." "It's food made by the Supreme Beings like Ainz-sama." What Cocytus brought over was food made with item called "Dagda's Cauldron". "Is that true! He could create enough fish for all of us to eat!" Shasuryu shook his head.
