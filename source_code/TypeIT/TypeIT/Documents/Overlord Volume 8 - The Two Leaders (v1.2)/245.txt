Enri could understand that her village's savior, the magic caster known as Ainz Ooal Gown, was a mighty being, but what she had seen today went beyond her wildest imaginings. It was as though she had stepped into a shining dreamscape, or a story where princesses and other great figures took center stage. The fireplace was decorated with glass birds that had been carved to lifelike perfection. If she broke one, she could work her entire life and still be unable to pay for it. The sofa was exquisite, and Enri wondered if she was dirtying it with her clothes. The chandelier, the first she had seen in her short life, was not lit by torches, lanterns, or candles, but by magic instead. She had seen magic lights before in E-Rantel's Adventurer's Guild, but they couldn't compare in brightness or style. The furniture was tasteful and luxurious. Of particular interest was the weightiness of the ebony table before her. Even though Enri had no idea how valuable these kinds of things were, she was still able to tell that this was a very valuable piece. A lifelike portrait of a beautiful woman hung on the wall, painted in intricate detail. Even the carpet on the floor made Enri hesitate to step on it. It was so soft that while sitting on the sofa, she gently raised her feet, thinking that it would be better not to let her feet touch the floor.
