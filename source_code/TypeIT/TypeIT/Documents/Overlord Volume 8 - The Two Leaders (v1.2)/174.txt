That item was the first bit of help the village received- Strange, was I the first person he helped? I do remember Gown-sama in a mask... Hm? Was he wearing a mask? Her memories of that incident were muddled, but that was only to be expected given the chaos of the situation. Enri shook her head to clear out her doubts. In any case... If the horn had been given to anyone else, that person would be the next chief, not herself. Which meant that the problem wasn't a matter of Enri's own competence, but it had been nothing more than sheer dumb luck. I should talk to someone about this... Nfirea was the first person she thought of. He'd lived in the big city before, seen a lot of people, and Enri felt that he would know if she could be the next chief. And he was widely read, so he would definitely be able to give her an answer. However, the chief had said that Nfirea - or rather, the Bareares - had approved of her succession. That meant that even if she talked with Nfirea, he would end up pushing her for the position. He won't do... and neither will any of the villagers. That leaves Agu and the ogres, but Agu already thinks of me as the chief, and the ogres are just plain dumb.
