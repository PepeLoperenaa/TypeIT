Like this, the five held their breaths and prayed that the source of the sound would turn in another direction. But unfortunately, this did not happen, and the figure making the noise finally came into Enri's field of view. "Eh?!" A tiny gasp of surprise escaped from Enri's mouth. It was a ragged-looking little goblin. His body was covered in tiny wounds which bled profusely. His breathing was rapid and uneven, and the smell of his blood and sweat spread throughout the area. Even though goblins were already smaller than humans, this goblin was small even for another goblin. To Enri and the goblin's trained observation skills, they came to the same answer of "child". The goblin child looked fearfully to his rear, in the direction where he had come from. There was no need to listen up for the sound of trampling plant life that followed from behind him. From the looks of things, they were hunter and prey. He frantically moved his spasming feet, taking cover in a patch of shade different from Enri's own. "That" "Quiet."
