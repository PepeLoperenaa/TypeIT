Of the goblin troop that Enri had summoned, twelve were level 9 goblins, two were level 10 goblin archers, one was a level 10 goblin mage, one was a level 10 goblin priest, two were level 10 goblin wolf riders and one was a level 12 goblin leader. In total, there were 19 goblins. Kaijali from this morning and Paipo who had helped with the chores were level 8, while Kiumei, who was wearing leather armor and carrying a lance, was a level 10 goblin wolf rider. The goblin riders' job was to patrol the plains and act as scouts. The riders periodically returning to the village to deliver reports was a common sight. "...Looks like it." However, Paipo's tone was very somber. It made her think that something bad had happened. "What's wrong?" "...He's back a little early. He should have been prowling the forest today... did something happen?" After hearing Paipo's explanation, a surge of unease rose in Enri's heart, and she feared that some bloody disaster awaited them. While the two of them waited in silence, the large wolf Kiumei rode on arrived in front of Enri. From its rapid breathing, she could guess how much of a hurry he had been to get back here. "What's the matter?"
