As they walked and talked, they reached the goblins' house. This was a place with a wide courtyard where you could raise and let wolves run around, capable of housing almost twenty people. It was a large building where they could train with and maintain their weapons. The goblins opened the door, and led the way for Enri and Lupusregina. "Fueeee- I didn't know there was a place like this" "Hmmm? Lupusregina-san, you're not coming in?" "Yup yup Can't go in without an invitation. Well, it's just a matter of etiquette, it's not like I can't really go in. I guess the only other one with such a weird legend is flatchest-san" "Flatchest-san1...?" "That's right, En-chan. It's the name of a tragic beauty. Well, it wasn't as though that person couldn't really go in. Legends, myths folklore - Weeeeeeell, let's not talk about that any more We're here to listen to what this goblin has to say, right?" "Ah, yes. Then, drinks... ehm, how about herbal juice and fruit juice? There's black grass tea and Hyueri water..." Agu and Lupusregina looked completely baffled by Unlai's question, so Enri helped explain for them. "Hyueri are citrus fruits, you cut them open and infuse them into water and it tastes clear and good. Black grass tea is a little bitter." 1 Shalltear Bloodfallen.
