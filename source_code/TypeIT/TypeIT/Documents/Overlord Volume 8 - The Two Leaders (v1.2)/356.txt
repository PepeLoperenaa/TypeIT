"Get her off Ainz-sama! No, no! Don't try to restrain her with skills! It's just going to get cancelled! Use your strength!" "It's too much! To be this strong, she is indeed the Overseer of Guardians! Mare-sama, help us!" "-Awawa! Y-yes!" Ainz fixed his clothing after being finally liberated and pointed to Albedo, who was being held by all four limbs by the Eight Edged Assassins. "Albedo shall be grounded for three days." The Eight Edged Assassins dragged Albedo out of the room. "U-uh, Ainz-sama... Are you alright?" "I'm fine... But when did Albedo turn so weird? Did she eat something bad...? Devils don't need to eat food, but there shouldn't be a problem with eating... right?" Mare looked away as Ainz asked the question. "Well... I guess, uh, mmm, there would have been this and that happening for her. She must have been under a lot of work-related stress." Ainz stood up from his place and called over the maid. To regain his dignity, he spoke in the most regal voice he could manage. "...Tell Narberal and Hamsuke to prepare. It's time to head to E-Rantel."
