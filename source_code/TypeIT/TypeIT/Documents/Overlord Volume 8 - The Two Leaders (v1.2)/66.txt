Enri pulled her face back. The others quickly followed suit. Behind the tree trunk, Enri opened her hands. Her skin was green and speckled with stray bits of plant matter. Beside her, Nfirea did the same thing. The sap and juices from the herbs we picked... This was the same sort of thing that Nemu was soaked in when she ground up the herbs. Although those with numbed noses (like themselves) wouldn't mind, but the powerful stench still hung in the air. Her heart raced, and Enri thought it was annoying. "It's started moving. ...Is it coming this way? Hasn't noticed us, has it?" Unlai, with his ear on the tree to listen, flashed a querying hand sign. "...are you telling me it can't use its sense of smell?" "What do you mean, Ani-san? Don't monsters have very sensitive noses...?" "It's because of that," Nfirea said as he explained himself. The key point was that because it had an extremely sensitive sense of smell, the stench floating in this area was particularly effective against it. The barghest had confused the scent of Enri's hands and bag with that of the already-harvested areas. Even better, the smell had covered up their original scent. It was also possible that the barghest had torn up the herbs to smoke the goblin child out.
