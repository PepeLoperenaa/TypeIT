"I was wondering what was happening at the entrance, so it was you people giving trouble to Ainz-sama." "O-Onee-san... is dead." "I'm not dead", the girl retorted weakly. "I was waiting for the two of you." "Sorry for being late. However... Overseer-san, isn't it about time for you to learn how to control your emotions?" Demiurge's narrow eyes widened slightly, showing his hostility openly. It was frightening when someone who was gentle became angry. True to these words, the atmosphere became tense. Influenced by the tension, Cocytus took a stance against Albedo too. Albedo was smiling as usual. No, her smile was deeper than usual. "- Fools!" Ainz roared angrily. "Do not quarrel in front of me! Imbeciles!" All the Guardians went down on one knee and trembled. "We are very sorry, Ainz-sama!" "...Enough, get up, everyone." After seeing that everyone was up, Ainz spoke gently as if to soothe troubled children.
