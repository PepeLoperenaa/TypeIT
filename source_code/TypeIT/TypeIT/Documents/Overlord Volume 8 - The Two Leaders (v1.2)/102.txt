If the hero who saved the village decided to make a move, not even the greatest monsters could hope to stand against him. However- "That's too naive." Enri mumbled to herself, and the goblins agreed. Only Brita and Agu, who didn't know of Ainz, were baffled. Nfirea had a complex expression on his face. "This village is our village. That means we should do as much as we can by ourselves. Although some people will think that I shouldn't be babbling pretty words since I can't fight and have no battle experience..." "No, I agree with Ane-san's opinion. This village is Ane-san's-" "Kaijali?" "Hm?" He tilted his head to correct himself. "Ane-san and us... no, that's not right either." "You're trying to say that the village belongs to everyone who lives here, right?" "That's right, Ani-san. You're getting it! Well, even so, I think borrowing the power of that magic caster-sama should wait until we're completely out of options."
