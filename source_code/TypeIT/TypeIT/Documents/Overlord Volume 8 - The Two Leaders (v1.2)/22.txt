Enri thought, "I have bigger biceps than he does", but Nfirea didn't stop there. "Which is to say!" "Yes, yes, that's wonderful, tell us about it later." Kaijali spoke as he took a step forward. "Ani-san here looks like he's been sleeping too little and partying too hard. Maybe he's high or something? Ane-san, let me take care of this. Why don't you go back first?" "Will it be all right?" "Sure it will. I'll splash some cold water on his face and when he calms down, I'll bring him over. If you take too long, others will get worried. Say, what about Obaa-chan?" "Obaa-chan's still got her head buried in her research... I don't think she'll be coming for breakfast. I'm sorry, you went through all this trouble to prepare breakfast for us..."
