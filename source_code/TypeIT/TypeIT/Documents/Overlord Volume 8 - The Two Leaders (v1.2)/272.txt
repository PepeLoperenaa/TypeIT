The three girls nodded in unison. It should be noted that all the maids carried several meals' worth of candy and other such treats on them. They would snack on them whenever they had free time while serving Ainz. However, be it fortunate or not, they simply could not find that free time. As such, the morning meal was very important to them. "Have you heard? They say they're going to cook using ingredients from the outside world and have a food tasting." The other two gasped at Sixth's statement. She felt that was natural, because few of the maids thought well of the outside world - the world that lay beyond Nazarick. Some of them felt that the outside world was inferior to Nazarick, but most of them were afraid of it, because the floor right above their home, the 8th floor, had once been invaded by people from the outside. "Can we all go to the tasting? Or will only a few of us be allowed to go?" Just as Sixth was about to answer Foire's question, the atmosphere in the canteen changed. The air itself seemed to heat up. As the newcomer came into the maids' sight, they couldn't help squealing in delight. "Shizu-chan!" "It's Shizu-chan!" The person who had just entered the canteen was one of the Pleiades, CZ Delta. The battle maids were like idols to the regular maids, and CZ was the most popular of them all. There were frequent struggles to sit next to her.
