"Does it need one?" The vampire shrugged at Albedo, who looked like she wanted a second opinion. "Probably? It is your pet after all." "It's not really a pet... Does the same one come out every time I summon?" On hearing Albedo's question, Shalltear raised her voice after having a good idea. "How about asking Kyouhukou? He is very skilled in summoning others of his species, so he would be very knowledgeable on the subject." "...I refuse. I feel bad because as a comrade in Nazarick, I shouldn't dislike him, but I just can't help it..." "Ah... It can't be helped. I'm sure he means well, but sometimes he tries to crawl up through your clothes. Though it seems like others like Entoma often visit him." "Do not speak of something so unpleasant. It makes my body itch just thinking about it... It truly is a room of terror. It is a floor under this one's control, but I do not wish to ever go there." "...Shalltear, did you know? Entoma calls that room the 'snack room'." "Eeeeeh? Really? Really?! Uwaaah I don't want to go near Entoma ever again."
