"Ahhhh, sorry, sorry, but you seemed so excited, I thought I needed to cool you down a bit. It was just a joke su" "It's a really bad joke..." Enri sagged her shoulders. However, she immediately recovered again. Lupusregina was a person who came and went as she pleased, if she didn't take this opportunity to pin her down she would vanish again. "Please hear me out. I need some advice on what to do next!" "I dunno what you're talking about, but we can talk while we walk right? I don't want the villagers to look at me strangely" Enri's face turned bright red. Lupusregina had a point there. However- "Buuuut if you want to violate me again I won't scream" "Ggk!" Lupusregina stuck her tongue out playfully at Enri. "Really - really, Lupusregina-san!" "Come, come, let's go, let's go." Without waiting for an answer, Lupusregina set off, and Enri followed.
