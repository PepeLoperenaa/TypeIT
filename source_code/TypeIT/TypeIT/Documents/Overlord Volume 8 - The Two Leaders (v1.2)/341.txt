"Well, I wouldn't know something like that. How about asking him directly when he returns? He should be back soon." "Then I'll do that. This is a different topic, but it looks like you're building something big here. What's it for? It doesn't look like a defense system for the village..." "Yes, we're building the fourth fish farm." Mare understood after Shasuryu explained the details. It was good that the lizardmen tribes were united, but there was the issue of their food supply. Even though there were many who died in the war, there was limited amount of food they could hunt from this area alone. The solution was to go back all the way to where the old villages used to be and hunt there, but the new overseer of the Lizardmen, Cocytus, did not allow this. Unlike when moving in large groups, like an entire tribe, when travelling in small numbers, there were chances of being attacked by monsters. Cocytus was worried that the already small number of lizardmen would reduced even further. So Cocytus tackled the issue of food head-on for the prosperity of the lizardmen. First, he brought over food from Nazarick - with Ainz's permission - and distributed it to the lizardmen. Next, he searched for a way to gather food semi-permanently. What naturally caught his attention was Zaryusu's fish farm. After a discussion with Demiurge, Cocytus went ahead with creating an even more effective fish farm.
