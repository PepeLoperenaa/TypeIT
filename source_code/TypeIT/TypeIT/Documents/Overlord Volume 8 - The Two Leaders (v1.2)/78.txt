As he answered, Nfirea was smearing the potion on the kid's body. The wounds were visibly closing up. "Uuuoooh! What's this? The color's so gross but it's so amazing!" The kid felt the stares of the surrounding goblins on him and trembled. "Ah... no, I, ah, th-thank y-you very m-much..." "Oh, looks like the punk has some manners after all." "Very good. This way, I can tell Gown-san that the experiment was completed without a hitch." Nfirea looked around, fumbling for approval. Enri and the goblins, who got what he meant, nodded to him. The potion Nfirea created was made from the materials provided by the great magic caster Ainz Ooal Gown, who was the savior of Carne Village. Not only was there no need to spend money on research fees, but he even provided all the necessary ingredients. With that in mind, the meaning and value of the potion that he had created was plainly obvious. The fact that Nfirea had decided to use it on his own was a major problem, but perhaps he could pass it off as a practical evaluation of the potion's effects. If I explain it to Gown-san after the fact, he'll probably allow it... experimentation is the fundamental principle of pharmacists, anyway. "You, you used me as a guinea pig!"
