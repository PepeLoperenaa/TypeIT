What's it about? Mare's shoulders flinched for a brief moment. He felt like his voice would crack, but then he barely managed to squeeze the words out. "N-n-n-n-nothing? It's nothing... but I need to go." Hmmm... Aura's voice sounded as if she was suspicious, and the thought of that caused Mare's hands to be soaked with sweat. But, uh, I can't help it. It's Ainz-sama's orders. Apart from Mare and Aura's creator -Bukubukuchagama- Ainz's words ranked higher than any other Supreme Being's. It took priority over anything else. Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Go then. Remember that the 5th floor is cold, so protect yourself against it... Ah, but if it's Mare there won't be a problem. "Y-yeah. It's fine if I use magic. Then I'll be off." If he kept talking for too long, he might give something away. So Mare quickly took his hand off the magic item. It sounded like his sister was trying to say something else before she was cut off, but whether it was fortunate for him or not, he couldn't hear it. "A-alright! Time to hurry."
