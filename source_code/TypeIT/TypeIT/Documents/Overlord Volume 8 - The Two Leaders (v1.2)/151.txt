"Mm. First, I'd like to ask for some help with the sale of herbs." "Understood. Where are the herbs now?" Enri told her they were on the wagon outside, and the receptionist turned to speak to a woman beside her. "The appraiser is going to check it now, please wait within the Guild until he's done." "Understood. Then, another thing... although we won't be putting out a request right away, we might do so in the future." Enri crudely explained the situation to the receptionist. The other woman's smiling face became more and more serious as she heard Enri's story. "Is that so... I'm just a receptionist, and I don't decide the difficulty of requests, but if it involves the Wise King of the Forest, it might be a task that only the adamantite-ranked Momon-san can handle. Of course, his services will not be cheap." Enri sensed a shift in the receptionist's mood. She seemed entirely unmotivated, as though she had decided "it's no use even if I tell you, what a pain". While living with the goblins, Enri had gradually learned to read the emotions of others. This was because goblins were ugly and looked much different from humans, and she had worked hard to recognize and deduce their feelings. It was a way Enri had grown.
