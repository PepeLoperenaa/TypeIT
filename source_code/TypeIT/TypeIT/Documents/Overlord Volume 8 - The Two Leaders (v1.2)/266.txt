Beside her was Lumiere, whose delicate face was crowned by her blonde hair which sparkled like stars. "Good morning. Now then Foire, since you shouldn't need seconds, you can wait here for us. I haven't had breakfast yet, so I'm going to get some. Come, Sixth, let's go." Lumiere stood, trailed closely by Foire, who was frantically saying, "I was just kidding, really" After that brief drama, the three of them went over to the self-service buffet counter. Before they left, they had the maid called Increment, who was quietly reading a book, watch over their seat for them. The first thing Sixth took at the buffet bar was a serving of crispy fried bacon. As a member of the faction which believed that "soft bacon is the devil", she always went for that first. Next, she helped herself to some soup. Of the three flavours today -soup of the day, corn and onion- she selected the last. After that were sausages, french fries and danishes. Her other plate was piled high with onion salad, almost to the point of spilling. Finally, Sixth placed an order with a masked manservant. "Um, I'll have triple cheese, double onions, and extra mushrooms." The manservant nodded, and began making the omelette. Sixth returned to her seat to put down her dishes, and then poured herself a glass of milk before returning to where the manservant was waiting with her freshly-prepared omelette.
