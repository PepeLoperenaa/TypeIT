"Isn't that right?" Even when she opened her eyes, her parents' smiles still floated before her. She replayed the tender moments of the past in her mind. After the tender memories came the turmoil in her heart. Driven by her hatred for the people who had murdered her parents, Enri slammed with all her might at the hunk of meat with her cleaver and split it in half. However, since she used too much force, she also chopped a divot out of the block, which made her furrow her brow in frustration. If the blade gets chipped, it's going to be hard to fix...... I'm sorry, k-kaa-san. Enri thought as she apologized for damaging the cleaver that was her only link to her deceased mother. She gently ran a finger along the edge to make sure it was fine, and at that moment, the door beside her, which led to the living room, opened up. The person who entered was not human, but someone shorter - one of the demihumans commonly known as goblins. "Morning, Ane-san. Today's our turn to... what's wrong?" The goblin paused in the middle of a perfect bow to turn concerned eyes to Enri's hands. Enri was a mere village girl, but the goblins served her without hesitation because she was their summoner.
