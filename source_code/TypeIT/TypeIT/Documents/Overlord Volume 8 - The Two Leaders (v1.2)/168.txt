Enri's expression would have transcended acting in terms of how quickly and dramatically her face changed. "Haaaaaaaa?! What, what is this? Hey! Don't tell me Agu was saying those... ehhhh?!" "You getting flustered won't help..." "Don't interrupt me when I'm flustered! Chief, are you retarded? Why are you saying this?!" "...Maybe retarded is a bit much. I understand you're excited and nervous about this - I know that much, but I'm hoping you can calm down and listen to me." "Calm down, how can I calm down? I'm just a girl, why do I have to deal with this village chief crap?!" "Get a hold of yourself!" The voice was full of power, but to Enri it was just a little loud. Even so, it helped her regain a bit of her composure. No, if she didn't listen to the chief, she'd never make sense of things, or at least that was what part of her was thinking. "I understand that you're very confused. However, I hope you can sit down and consider things with a clear head. For starters, who is the heart of the village?"
