"To start, the healing potions of this world are blue. But the healing potions I know of are red. Curious, don't you think?" Ainz rambled. The knowledge and powers of YGGDRASIL were applicable to this world. From the angels he had first encountered, to the apparent existence of World-Class Items, there was a very high chance that players had been here in the past. In that case, why was it that the potions were not red like in YGGDRASIL? There were three possibilities. First, the downfall of a country might have resulted in the loss of those potion-making techniques. These techniques should have been quite widespread, and nothing short of an entire country's destruction would be able to wipe them out. The second reason might have been that Nfirea simply did not know these techniques since they had not spread to the nearby countries. Perhaps distant countries might be using red potions. After all, in Japan, the same soup looked completely different when prepared on different sides of the country. The third reason was optimization: making in-game potions would require in-game materials. Maybe those materials were difficult to find here, or they weren't available at all, and that's why only blue potions could be made with this world's materials. "That is to say, except for the second possibility, this potion that Nfirea made-" Ainz swirled the purple potion in its vial. "This might be a once-in-a-century technological revolution, for all I know. Well, if it's the third possibility, this might turn out to be a failed product after all. His hard work in the future will give me the answer." Ainz hoped that Nfirea would be able to make in-game potions without consuming in-game materials. Who knew, perhaps he might end up making a third, completely different potion. "Then, wouldn't it be more effective to let more people research the subject?"
