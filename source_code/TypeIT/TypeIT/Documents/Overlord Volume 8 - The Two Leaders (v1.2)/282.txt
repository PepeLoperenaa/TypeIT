"No, that's too much. Its basic status is no different from a regular bicorn. It doesn't have special abilities, only enhanced HP, strength and agility." "Ah, I guess if you don't have 'Rider' class skills, it's hard to evolve a mount. If it fights alongside us in battles between level hundreds, it could become a hindrance because of its lack of special abilities." "Yea, but I can protect this child with my skill, so it'll be able to fight alongside me for long enough." "But do you not think it would be a waste to divert your resources like that? You will have plenty of openings in a battle like that. How about strengthening it by changing the equipment? I heard that mount-class monsters could be equipped with armour and horseshoes." "That's right. You can change its equipment even if the mount was summoned with a skill. It's somewhat related with Aura's question earlier. For example, if you equip it with horseshoes imbued with the power of flight, it could go around flying, but since I already equipped it with speed enhancing equipment... That might be difficult." Albedo lightly petted her mount that was standing beside her. But the bicorn staggered a little as if Albedo had put some strength behind her tap. There was no way that the mount she summoned would be unable to bear such a light tap. When Albedo started frowning, wondering if the beast was being rebellious, Aura asked another question. "Hehe So what's the name?" "It's a bicorn, like you said earlier." "No, not that. I don't mean the species name, but its name."
