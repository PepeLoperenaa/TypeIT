Nfirea nodded as Brita spoke. "Then, I guess I'll be leaving the village for a bit su You really won't ask Ainz-sama for help?" "Yes. We'd like to do as much as possible by ourselves. If possible, we'd like you to tell Gown-sama that much." "Got it su" As Agu looked at Enri and Nfirea, who were moving off, a hard-to-describe feeling welled up within him. "Just what's so great about that woman?" "Hah?!" There was danger in the adult goblin's voice, and it made Agu's body tremble. Agu felt that the adult goblins were stronger than anyone else in his village. It was only natural for him to break out in goosebumps when threatened by them. Yet, this still could not overcome his childish curiosity. "Are women really that great in this Carne tribe?" From Agu's point of view, Enri didn't seem particularly strong. Although she had some muscle on her arms and legs, it wasn't enough at all. While she didn't need to be as big as an ogre, but if she were a superior, she needed way more than that.
