Overlord Volume 8 Side Story 1 Enri's Upheaval and Hectic Days Translator: Nigel Editors/Proofreaders: Ferro, TaintedDream, Namorax, Skythewood, SifaV6, Rockgollem, JcqC, ZackTan Part 1 Enri Emmot rose before the sun came up to make breakfast. There was a lot of food to prepare, and she wasn't as good a cook as her deceased mother. Counting Nemu, Enri herself and the nineteen goblins loyal to her, she had to make breakfast for twenty-one people. Cooking for two more on top of everyone's would make twenty-three in total. Preparing that much food was a lot of work, and could be considered a battle in its own right. Enri trembled while looking at the vast quantity of food in front of her and realised that it would all be gone in one meal. "This is nearly six times as much as before..." After taking a deep breath, she rolled up her sleeves, psyched herself up and got to work. She sliced the vegetables up quietly, and then the meat. The process had been engraved into Enri's brain by now. Although Enri was not especially talented at cooking, the fact that she had learned to cope with such an enormous task in such a short time was a textbook example of how diamonds were made under pressure.
