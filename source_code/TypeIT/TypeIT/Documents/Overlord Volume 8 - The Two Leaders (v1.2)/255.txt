velout sauce. The second will be a dish of Poiret's foie gras of Vpnir. The soup will be an Alfheim-style cream of sweet potato and chestnut soup. We have selected meat for the main course, which would be the marbled steak made from Jotunheim's ancient frost dragons that Ainz-sama mentioned earlier. After that comes dessert, which would be Golden Apple compote, served in white wine and topped with yogurt. In addition, we have black tea-flavoured ice cream coated in gold leaf. For the after-meal beverages, we have considered that coffee may not suit everyone's taste, so we also have fresh peach juice. That is all. If any part of the menu requires amendment, please inform us and we will do so immediately." Is this a spell incantation?! Enri, who had no clue about what had just been recited, was sure of that. "Doesn't everyone like foie gras? I think children will. Please add it to the menu for me. How about something light?" "Yes. Then, we shall add scallop salad and star plum confit as hors d'oeuvres." "Hmm, there is that... is this menu better than the previous one?" "Eh?! You're asking me?!" Enri, who had been suddenly put on the spot, answered frantically. It would be very confusing if she had to keep talking about this stuff she knew nothing about.
