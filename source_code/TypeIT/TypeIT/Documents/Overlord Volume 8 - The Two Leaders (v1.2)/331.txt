"Y-yea. Uh, you know, I was wondering if you could lend me some servants over level 75 from here." "I understand. Thou seek'st to go outside." "Huh? Y-yeah. You guessed it." "...Mine ears hath never forgotten a word from the Overlord, Ainz-sama. Also considering thy position, 'tis an easily deducible conclusion - Good!" He made a decision in a flash. "I shall lend thee the Overlords of this Library: Cocceius, Ulpius, Aelius, Flavius and Aurelius." "Eh? Really?!" "Of course. Verily, their presence here is an extravagance. They would rejoice having the chance to defend thine person as opposed to these ancient tomes." "T-then, uh, thank you very much!" "But that doth not mean it shall be for free. I shalt ask one thing from thee; to aid in the creation of a scroll." "Ah, yes! What do I need to do?" "Be at ease. When I speaketh so, activate thine 4th tier magic towards the scroll."
