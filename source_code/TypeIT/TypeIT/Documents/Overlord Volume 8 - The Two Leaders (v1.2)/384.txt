Narberal's interruption made Ainz swallow the words he was about to say. His brain spun into high gear, and he struggled to recall that encounter in ERantel. That's right! At that time, I just did it so I wouldn't be seen as a cheapskate! Damn! Ainz maintained his calm demeanour. Caught with his pants down, he had to tell a lie to cover up another lie. He struggled to muster up the vestiges of his rapidly-vanishing courage. "...Is that all you thought I was doing, Narberal?" "I am very sorry!" "...No, this isn't something you should apologize for. At the time, I wasn't confident my plan would work out, so I chose a simpler explanation." "Then... what was your real aim?" In the face of Narberal's questions, Ainz's jaw hung open for a moment at a loss for words. But in that moment, inspiration struck. With that as the basis for his confidence, Ainz prepared to speak. "...It was Nfirea..." As Ainz slowly opened his mouth, he took in the subordinates around him. If Demiurge or Albedo were present, they would probably interrupt and say, "Ah, so that's how it is. As expected of Ainz-sama." Narberal, on the other hand, could only furiously furrow her brows.
