At this moment, someone called out to the frowning Enri with a cheerful voice. "Ossu Seems like they're done talking... Oya? What's wrong, you've got a strange look on your face? Problem, Enri?" That voice made Enri tingle as though electricity were coursing through her skin. That's right. She was an outsider to the village, a neutral third party who could calmly and logically assess the situation. Enri ran toward Lupusregina with all her strength. "Lupusregina-san!" She tightly clutched the surprised maid's shoulders. "What what what what's this? Oh no My heart's beating so fast. But please don't confess to me. I'm not a lesbian, I like the opposite sex. Noooooo Let me go I'm going to be raped su" "Wait! Please, wait a bit!" Enri's hands left her shoulders, because she was planning to cover Lupusregina's mouth. But she nimbly slipped out of Enri's grasp and smiled to her.
