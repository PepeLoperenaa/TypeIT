"Enfi, who do you think I am? I can still make simple clothes on my own." "Is that it? I bought all my clothes, so being able to make your own sounds awesome." "Well, thanks for that. But everyone in the village can... Nemu, you'd better start learning." "Kay" "Then, Nemu, do you mind heading back first? I need to discuss something with Enfi." Nemu covered her mouth with her hands, but the smile was already making her eyes sparkle. "Mm! Got it! Then, I'll be going first. Good luck, Enfi-kun!" Nemu waved to them, then headed back home with a spring in her step. Enri watched her as she left, mumbling to herself. "She's so obedient. Nevermind, are you hiding anything from me?" "No, I don't think... ah, you mean that? Is that it? Although I can roughly guess, since I was at the town council meeting yesterday."
