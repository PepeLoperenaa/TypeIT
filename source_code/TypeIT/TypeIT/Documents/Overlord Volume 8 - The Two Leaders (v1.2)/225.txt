Nfirea's aim was to buy time. If the enemy stopped attacking and went on guard, he hoped it would continue to stay that way. "...Damn, this hurts. I don't want to die..." Nfirea gave voice to his despair. In the end, this was all his life had amounted to. He didn't want to face this fact, but the circumstances were forcing him to acknowledge it. He would die here. There was no doubt that his existence would end here. He wanted to run. Maybe if he ran with all his strength he might be able to escape. But if that happened, what manner of tragedies would occur? Nfirea thought of Enri. He was able to fight because he had Enri. "So I told her after all... damn. I don't want to die before I hear her answer." The ever-approaching troll could not understand what the young man was feeling.
