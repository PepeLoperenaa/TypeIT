He could feel his body warming up a little, but it wasn't as comfortable compared to his time as a human. The drawbacks of being undead... While Ainz was missing the joy he had lost- "Hmm?" -He lifted his head above the steam and looked at the surroundings. "May I ask what is the problem?" "I think someone is calling my name." "Did. It. Come. From. Next. Door?" Cocytus gestured at the wall behind him. "That side is- I see, the women's bath." "I see, but... Are the walls that thin?" "Maybe. They. Are. Just. Too. Loud." Ainz focused on his hearing. He didn't have any ulterior motives, just a bit curious about what the girls were chatting about. He didn't stick his ears to the wall. That would be an action ill befitting the ruler of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. Keeping some distance from the wall, he tried his best to eavesdrop on the sound from next door.
