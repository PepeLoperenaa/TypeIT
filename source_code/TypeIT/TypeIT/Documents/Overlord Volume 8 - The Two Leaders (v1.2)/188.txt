Lupusregina laughed as her older sister grumbled. "Ah will the village be destroyed after all?" Part 4 "Ah, I'm so tired." Enri dumped the small slate she was holding on the table and flopped down, devoid of energy. She turned to look at the source of the quiet laughter and saw Nfirea there with a smile that said 'just as planned' on his face. "You've worked hard, Enri." "It's soooo haaaaard I'm not good at using my head..." "You need to learn how to read and write, you know." Enri's reply was a mournful whine. As the village chief she needed a basic level of education, which was why Nfirea was personally instructing her, but Enri's head felt like it was splitting apart. "These stupid words, they were made up just to give me trouble..." "Don't say that. You've already learned how to write your own name, haven't you? And Nemu-chan's as well."
