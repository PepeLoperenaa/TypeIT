There was only one reason to go to the canteen this early in the morning. When she arrived, almost all her colleagues had already gathered for breakfast and started eating. The canteen was predominantly white in color, with sparse decoration. The echo of the girls' cheerful chatter echoed off the walls like ripples in water. It wouldn't have been much of a problem if there was only one person, but since there were many people speaking, their voices blended into incomprehensible noise. On top of that, the sound of clinking tableware added to the din. The maids in the canteen could be separated into four main groups. The first three were grouped according to their creators. There were forty-one regular maids in total, but it was not because each Supreme Being created their own maid. Rather, the regular maids were created by Whitebrim, Herohero, and Coup De Grce. Strictly speaking, the last group wasn't a proper group by itself, but composed of those maids who had detached themselves from the first three groups in order to eat in silence, to eat while reading or to talk to maids from the other groups. Sixth, who came in late, belonged to the last group. She greeted the maids made by the same Supreme Being as herself -they were her sisters, in a sense- and then headed to her usual place. "Good morning... have you eaten?" "Good morning. And yes, we've already eaten. Breakfast was so good so smooth and creamy, so tasty" Foire delivered this deadpan reply. She was bad at lying, but lied anyway. She had short hair and her maid skirt was similarly shortened to match her energetic appearance.
