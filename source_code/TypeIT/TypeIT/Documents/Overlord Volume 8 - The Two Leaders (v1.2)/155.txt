"Ah, I'm sorry, but I was just about to tell her about the results of the appraisal-" "You shut up, I'm talking here." The receptionist's reply made the merchant's face twitch. "If it's alright with you, would you like to discuss this over a drink in the receiving room?" She was smiling, but the smile didn't reach her eyes. Instead, there was a desperate, struggling feeling in them. Perhaps she had sensed something from the confused Enri. The receptionist's eyes were moist, and her hands were clasped together as though in prayer. "Please, I'm begging you, you have to let me hear you out! If not, I'll be done for!" After hearing that desperate, almost pathetic plea, Enri didn't want to talk to her at all, but it seemed too cruel not to give her a chance. She glanced back to the merchant, who seemed to pick up on her intentions, because he nodded slightly to her. "Got, got it. Then, could you show me the way?"
