They were the last outsiders to arrive in the village. Although they weren't shunned or treated badly, there was still a distance between them. However, from the look of things, that gap would vanish if they won today. It was ironic that the battlefield was the best place to build the bonds of camaraderie. And it was because he felt that gap that Agu fought so fiercely. His objective was to contribute to the village and raise the standing of himself and his people. In human society, they would show respect to people who shed blood for them. Agu and his people had the welfare of his people in mind, so his passion was only natural. "Enfi, I have something to ask of you." Enri stood beside Enfi, and whispered into his ear. "Oh, no, further a little - ah. Mm. Got it. Then - Agu, I have something to entrust to you. Take these alchemical items and use them well." Enfi opened his satchel. Inside were many bottles and papers. "Use these and throw them at the enemy. You'll miss if you're too far away, so try to use them at medium range. You ready?" "Leave it to me! Watch me accomplish my mission perfectly!" Agu accepted the satchel, and as there were waiting, one of the goblins shouted down to them.
