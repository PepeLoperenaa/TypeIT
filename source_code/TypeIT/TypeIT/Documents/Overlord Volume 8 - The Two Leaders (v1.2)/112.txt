Sensing Enri's surprised expression, Jugem followed up with an explanation. "When we found the survivors of Agu's tribe, they were being held by the Giant of the East's ogres, and used as food. Although Cona healed the wounds of their bodies, their minds are still scarred. Ani-san has some medicine to calm them down, and we want him to help treat them. After that, there's a somewhat more troublesome matter." Jugem watched Enri's expression before continuing. "When we rescued them, we captured five ogres. Although we only did it to question them... it seems ogres normally coexist with goblins, and while the ogres fight, the goblins provide food, shelter, and so on, in a mutually beneficial relationship. Because of that, they said they're willing to fight for our tribe. According to Agu, this isn't uncommon... so, what should we do?" "Can we trust them?" "Agu says we can. The ogres won't fight for anyone apart from the goblins of their tribe, they betrayed the Giant of the East because he wasn't of their tribe. It's something like that." "Mm. But, ogres sound kind of scary..." "Once they accept the people in the village as part of their tribe, all you need to do is feed them and it'll be fine. You can give them just about any kind of food too. The ogres' tendency to eat anything is quite helpful here." Honestly speaking, this decision was very difficult for a simple village girl to make. "How about killing them?"
