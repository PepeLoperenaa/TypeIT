Lupusregina was carrying a weapon that looked like some sort of oversized religious symbol, using it like a shield to block the troll's fist. The weapon's dimensions and the maid's size seemed completely mismatched to the point of surreality, but this was no illusion. "Then, I'll take care of this guy. ...Oh wait, Enfi-chan's hurt. Heal." The troll stepped back, unable to understand the scene before it. The blow which it had put its full strength into had been blocked by a human, so its reaction was only to be expected. Perhaps it thought there was some kind of magic at work here. With a stunned expression, Enfi limped away from the troll, turning his back to it. It was a thoroughly unguarded posture, but the troll didn't press the attack. No, it couldn't just ignore the newcomer. "Enfi!" Enri hugged Nfirea tightly. "Ah, it's Enri." His dreamlike reply told Enri that he was at his limit. Although he was out of danger, he was still in shock.
