immigrants from the city would probably blanch at the sight and do their best to stay away. And frankly speaking, if Enri were forced to choose between the citydwellers and the goblins, she would choose the goblins without hesitation. At this moment, the wagon shook, and the sound of something metallic hitting the wagon bed rang out from behind her. "Ah, sorry. Are you alright?" Enri turned her head to look behind. Although the goblins were seated on the floor of the wagon, there were some sacks there, one of which made the metallic noise when the wagon shook. "Ah, we're fine, Ane-san. No need to worry. Speaking of which, with this many arrows, we'll be able to hunt to our hearts' content." The goblins looked so happy when they looked at the bag that Enri forgot to reply to them, simply smiling instead. They crossed the wheat fields, and entered a half-opened gate. After greeting everyone, Enri drove the wagon to their original meeting point, in order to unload the cargo.
