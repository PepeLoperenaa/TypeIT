And my little sister too!" Today was the day that the village's savior, Ainz Ooal Gown, had invited Nfirea to his home. However, she felt unease when she heard that even a mere village girl like herself could go along. Their host was a powerful magic caster, and they were people who lived in completely different worlds. The idea that she might accidentally do something rude made her stomach hurt. "It's cool since we're celebrating Enfi-chan's new invention, his girlfriend En-chan can come along, no problem. Ainz-sama said so too, yanno. Formality's not such a big deal." "...Lupus, mind your tone." "Yuri-nee, what's wrong with that? We're friends, right? En-chan" "Eh? Ah, yes. Yes. Just like that. Mm." Yuri sighed with a 'Haaa...', then walked to the front of a nearby wall. Suddenly, as though erupting from some form of space, a gigantic wooden closet appeared. It was big enough for people to pass through with ease, and its exterior was intricately carved, so it looked like a decorative closet.
