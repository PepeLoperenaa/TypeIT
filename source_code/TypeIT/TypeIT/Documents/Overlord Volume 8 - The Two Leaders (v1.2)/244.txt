"Really, think nothing of it. She was moved by the sight of my residence, was she not? Then that is no insult to me." Ainz seemed to be in a good mood as he replied. "Then... next up, I intended to speak to Nfirea-kun... Nemu, how about it? Do you want to see the home that I, no, that we created together?" "Yes! I wanna see! I want to see the amazing house Gown-sama and his friends made!" Nemu spoke before Enri could refuse. "Hahaha. Very well, very well! I have such sights to show you..." Enri was unable to speak, once she saw the good mood Ainz was in.    She settled down onto a recliner, remembering that she had been asked to wait in the receiving room while Nemu was shown around. Rather than say she was invited here, it would be more accurate to say that she was like a small animal that had been taken from its nest. She sat uneasily, and looked around herself. Beside her  regardless of the size of this place, the two of them stuck closely to each other  her lover Nfirea was also unable to keep still, much like a small animal himself.
