"Flattery will get" "As pretty as Lupusregina..." As she saw the consternation in the eyes looking at her, Enri immediately regretted the stupid things she'd said. She probably didn't even know about Lupusregina. However, there was nobody else who could even come close to the vision in front of her. What should I do, I've upset her... well, that much is clear, but... "About that, Lupusregina is a very pretty person in my village" "Thank you." "Eh?!" Her eyes were hard, and so was her voice, and even her eyebrows were straining. But the thanks she had given was genuine. "...Haaaah. Momon-sasan has some things to ask you, which is why I came. Don't waste time. Why are you here?" Enri had no obligation to answer. However, this was the partner of someone who had helped her. If he wanted to know, then she should answer. "That, before that, can I ask a favor of you? Momon-san helped me earlier, and I'm very, very grateful. Please tell him that."
