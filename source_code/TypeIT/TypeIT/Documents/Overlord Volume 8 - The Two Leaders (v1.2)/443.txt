The sudden male voice made Ainz and the others looked at each other. "Eh, that sounds like a man." "I. Never. Imagined. That. I. Would. Hear. This. In. Person. That. Is. The. Area. Guardian. Of. The. Bath. Right? But. Is. There. A. Man. In. The. Female. Bath?" "No, I've heard that voice before... It's Lucifer-san." When he heard the ominous voice of that man, Ainz recalled the various troubles that Lucifer had caused. To be honest, he didn't really like that man. "One of the Supreme Beings!?" "-So hard! This is not a simple steel golem! Albedo!" "-Die! You scrap metal golem!" With the loud sound of impact, something crashed hard onto the wall. Even the wall on the men's side was shaking. "...Basically, prepare yourselves to charge into the women's bath in full gear should the need arise." Ainz issued his command to the reluctant Guardians. The fiasco should end if they disarmed the attack mode set up by his comrades, but they should be having an all-out battle next door. With their gear off, the women's combat potential would drop drastically, so they might need to help them if the situation called for it.
