Seeing that Enri was okay with it, the soldier sighed with relief. He didn't want to be the one who angered a possible magic caster. The soldier who left returned once more, this time with a man trailing behind him. This man was a magic caster. His nose protruded like an eagle's beak, while his thin face was sallow and pale. His body was wrapped in a black robe that looked very hot. His sweat flowed freely, and his hands which resembled claws clutched his curved staff tightly. If the soldier had his say, he would have gotten rid of that robe if it was so hot, but the magic caster personally liked that style, and stubbornly refused to change his clothes. As such, when the magic caster entered the room, the temperature seemed to rise by a few degrees. "So it's this girl, then?" The magic caster spoke calmly, which his soldier escort found strange, as usual. Although he seemed to be a man in his twenties, his extremely hoarse voice made it impossible to determine how old he was by his voice alone. Was it that his appearance was abnormally young, or that his voice was abnormally hoarse?
