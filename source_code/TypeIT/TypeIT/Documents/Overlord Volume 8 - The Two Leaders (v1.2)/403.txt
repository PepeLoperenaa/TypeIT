to know that clubs were subpar weapons. It was a troll that had awakened as a warrior. "So you are the Giant of the East?" When the other party didn't deny it, Ainz pointed slightly to the right of the troll. "I would be really happy if you are the Serpent of the West. Are you?" Normal beings would think that there was nothing in the direction Ainz was pointing, but Ainz could see as clear as day that a heteromorphic being was there. "You probably think you can hide using invisibility, but I have seen through it. You can stop your futile actions now." After dispelling its invisibility, a monster appeared in that empty space. It was indeed a serpent. No, it only had the shape of a serpent. The upper body was that of a frail old man while the lower half was a snake. Such monsters existed in the game and Ainz stated its race immediately. "A Naga. It might be mistaken for a snake, but isn't that an exaggeration? No, a title like Virtuous King of the Forest exists too, so it makes sense." "To see through this one's invisibility, could it be-" "-Why are you here, skeleton!" A loud voice reverberating within the cave drowned out the words of the Naga as the Giant of the East took a step forward. With someone worth speaking to in front of him, Ainz faced the creature head on.
