"Get a hold of yourself, Albedo. Get down from me right this instant!" He tried to push her off by force, but the opponent was a level 100 warrior. Plus, he could not use his full strength because he was grabbing something extremely soft while trying to push her off. Albedo's hands closed in and tried to open up Ainz's robe. "Don't try to take off my clothes! Don't move your hips! Oi!" "Ah. Awawawawawawa..." "It's your fault, Ainz-sama! I held it in so far, but you started saying things that I can't hold myself anymore! It's all Ainz-sama's fault! I just need a little bit! Just a little bit! Really, a little bit! Please, give me some of your favour! It'll be over by the time you're finished counting the number of Eight Edge Assassins on the ceiling!" If she had mentioned that it was Ainz's fault for changing her setting, he would have lost all will to resist. However, Albedo looked like she was about to devour Ainz whole and the fear of being eaten, like that of prey being cornered by a predator, overrode Ainz's guilt and he struggled against her. Finally, his subordinates, who were confused at this sudden situation, sprang into action. "Albedo-sama has lost her mind!" "Albedo-sama has lost her mind!" The Eight Edge Assassins jumped off the ceiling simultaneously.
