As. Well. Right?" "I'm not interested. Also, you can enjoy it without resistance anyway. Can't you endure this bit of discomfort, Cocytus?" "Are. You. Taunting. Me. Demiurge- Interesting." "Take it easy, bathing is a leisure. Go to the sauna if you want to compete in endurance. Don't push yourself if it gets too hard." "Phew." Mare's forehead was sweating as he exhaled hotly. "Look, that's how a bath should be. Don't push yourself too hard Mare, get out of the pool if you can't take it anymore alright?" "No, no problem Ainz-sama! I will use magic if I really can't take it!" That would be weird too, Ainz thought without saying it out loud. He shifted his gaze towards Demiurge. "...Is entering the pool with your resistance on the correct way?" "That is one way of doing it, Ainz-sama. It is similar to Ainz-sama who is an undead creature that can't get wet." "...That's true."
