The goblins were still arguing, and although it probably wasn't safe to leave them alone for too long lest the conflict spiral out of control, Nfirea was really out of it, and she couldn't ignore him. He was most likely suffering from sleep deprivation, judging by the way he'd begun wobbling the moment he sat down, as though he'd fall over to his side at any moment. When he actually started on breakfast, he looked like a zombie, completely bereft of life or animation. "Ah... don't... worry... about... me... Enri...hu..." "Hey, Enfi, get it together!" "Weren't you the one who said 'Nemu was mai waifu' and all that earlier?" "That was then, this is now. I only just realised it recently. I used to think since Nemu-san was ten and was about the same height as us, that she was of a marriageable age. But humans... they only consider them adults at fifteen!" "Eh? Is that true....? Ane-san isn't a species like hob-human??" The goblins leapt from topic to topic with incomparable speed. Enri wanted to ask them what a 'hob-human' was, but before she could open her mouth, the goblins had already gotten tired of the discussion and started a whole new argument for everyone to participate in. "Ah! You stole my bread!" "My wolf's still hungry, don't be such a tightwad!" "Everyone!"
