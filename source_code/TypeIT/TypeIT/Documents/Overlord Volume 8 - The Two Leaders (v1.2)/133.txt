"That..." Enri turned a surprised look at the magic caster who had replaced the soldier. In his heart, the soldier thought that her surprise was inevitable. He too, had been frightened the first time he saw the man. "This is a magic caster from the Magician's Association. He's going to perform a simple check, so please wait." The soldier gestured to Enri to remain seated, and then nodded to the magic caster. "I'll leave this to you, then?" "Of course." The magic caster took a step toward Enri, and then he cast his spell. "Detect Magic." After that, the magic caster squinted his eyes, like a beast sizing up its prey. Yet, Enri remained calm in the face of this strange sight. Seeing that, all the soldiers could think was "No wonder".
