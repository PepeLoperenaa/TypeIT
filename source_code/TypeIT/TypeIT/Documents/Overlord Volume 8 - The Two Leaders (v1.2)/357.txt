   Nazarick Time 13:35 Sitting on top of Hamsuke, Ainz pulled the reins to signal him to halt. He looked over E-Rantel's gate which stood strong in front of him. Ainz did not dislike the gate, which could easily stop an entire army and radiated power and gravity. In Yggdrasil, there were many gates larger and more magnificent than this one, but unlike simple data, this gate was made with human hands -though the possible help of magic could not be discounted- and sweat. Standing before the steely gate steeped in history and labour, an indescribable emotion welled up from inside him. There were guilds that conquered and used a city as their base in Yggdrasil. I used to wonder why they would set up a base in areas so difficult to defend... but I think I can understand now. Ruling a great city might be the dream of any man. Back in Yggdrasil, it was a common occurrence for different guilds to lay siege to a city. Most members of Ainz Ooal Gown could not understand why they would do that, but there were also a few members who said they wanted to try it as well. Warmongers... It was not a good label, but looking back, it was a good memory. "What is it, my lord?" "Nothing. Don't worry about it." Hamsuke asked because her master had halted and took no further action. Ainz replied in a plain tone, as though trying to change the topic. It was a voice to hide his embarrassment about the fact he was caught up in the memories of good old days.
