There were three types of monsters inside Nazarick. The first type consisted of monsters that were created in a similar manner as player characters. The next type consisted of automatically spawning monsters that were under level thirty, and the last type consisted of monsters that were summoned as mercenaries. Mercenary monsters needed to be summoned using a book, a special summoning ritual and adequate amount of gold. Thus, they could not be summoned without a book. The second category was magic items. Certain data crystals could only be imbued into a book-shaped object. Items shaped like books usually tended to be single use magic items. The difference between a scroll and a book was that while scrolls could only be used by certain classes, anybody could use a book. The third category was event items. It was not uncommon for an item to be required when advancing into a special class, and some of these items came in the shape of a book. Even Ainz needed a "Book of the Dead" when he evolved from a Skeleton Mage into an Elder Lich. There were other books such as "Bibliography of Weapon Research" or "Anecdotes of the Four Great Spirits". There were also books that taught new magic. The fourth category was cosmetic skin data. These books contained the cosmetic skin data of objects like swords, shields and armour. Players with certain blacksmith skills could put new skins on items with this and other appropriate materials. The fifth category was novels in the form of book shaped items.
