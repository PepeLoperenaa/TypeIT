What a laughable sight, Ainz smiled wryly as he pulled his face away slightly in order to speak with Albedo. "My finger pierced Ainz-sama's important place..." Albedo's entire face blushed red, her eyes were wet and there was a fragrance about her. It was similar to what Ainz smelled on his bed. "- Hey, I already asked this before, but isn't this girl really weird?" Aura asked her question while holding Shalltear back, while Ainz was stunned. "...My sincere apologies, Ainz-sama. I couldn't help myself. Eh, please think of this as the result of accumulating too much stress from working for Nazarick. Please." "That, that can't be helped. Yes. Albedo, I am grateful for the hard work you put in everyday." Ainz who wanted to walk away in brisk steps was stopped by a hand grabbing his robes. There was no need to wonder who this hand belonged to. "Albedo, what is the matter? Why are you so reluctant to let me leave?" "When I hear these words... It ignites a fire in my heart. My abdomen is also squirming. That's why- Ainz-sama..." "Hey, wait, calm down Albedo! Co-Cocytus!"
