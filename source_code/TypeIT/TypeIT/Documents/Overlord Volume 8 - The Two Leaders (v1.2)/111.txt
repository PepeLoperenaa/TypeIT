Enri opened the door slightly, and squeezed her body out through the gap. She was worried that the moonlight coming in would wake Nemu. Understanding from her movements, Jugem lowered his voice and spoke. "There's something we need Ane-san for." "Now?" Enri smiled."Of course." "I'm really sorry about this." Enri followed in Jugem's footsteps while telling him not to apologize. It might have been better for Nemu to be awake for this, and she'd considered it, but Jugem had come for her knowing that everyone else was asleep. There had to be a reason for it. "I'll explain as we move along." Maybe he was more tired than usual, but this was work  after Jugem made up his mind, his words took on an edge. Although Enri felt that it was okay to be more casual with a simple village girl like herself, Jugem had never let himself relax up till now, so Enri gave up on that idea. "Firstly, we found some members of Agu's tribe." "That's wonderful!" "...but they're emotionally fragile, and I think they'll need to rest for a few days. We'll need to borrow Ani-san for this."
