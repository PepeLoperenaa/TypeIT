"Mm. Well, that's how it is. They say it's better for a teacher to be hated by their students than to be thanked by them." "That's a lie! It's a total lie!" "Ahahaha. Ah, I'm out of time. Goodnight, Enri." "Mm. Goodnight. Don't work too hard when you get back and sleep early." Nfirea smiled to show he understood, and then he left through the front door. After watching the floating mote of his magical light recede into the distance, Enri returned to her house. In the darkness, it felt especially lonely. "Ah I'm so tired..." Enri lazily stripped off her clothing and burrowed under the covers. She'd been so noisy when learning just now, but now all she could hear were the cute sounds of her little sister sleeping. Enri calmly closed her eyes. Having worked her brains so hard earlier, Enri was certain she would fall asleep right away. Just as she expected, she passed out within seconds of closing her eyes. She didn't know how long she'd slept, but a distant sound woke her from her slumber.
