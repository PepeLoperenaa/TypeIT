"You are well informed. This is one of the reasons. We will be sending Hamsuke out to battle in the future, so improving defence is necessary." If she learned martial arts, Hamsuke would be able to wear full plate armour. However, evasion and mobility would be lowered if the armour was equipped right now... In order to counter this- If Hamsuke learns martial arts, that would allow for smooth movements, even while wearing full plate armour. If we were in the game- No, even right now, I am unable to wear metal armour. Considering that, we are a long way from success... If there was another Hamsuke, we could test another method... Overall, the exact differences between this new world and the game rules were still a mystery. Demiurge would be able to find out by experimenting thoroughly, but Ainz didn't feel like doing so for some reason. Magic, something that runs contrary to the laws of physics, exists in this world. The concept that nothing is true, everything is permitted might have been forced onto me... "Is something the matter, Ainz-sama?" "Hmm? No, nothing. Why do you ask?" "Because you looked as if you were thinking about something, I was just wanted to know if that was the case." "Ahhh, that so? Just pondering trivial matters, nothing important." "I see."
