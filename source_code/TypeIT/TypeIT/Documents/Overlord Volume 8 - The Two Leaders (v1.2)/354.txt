When he opened his eyes, the Eight Edge Assassins came into view. Ainz understood that he was somehow lying on the floor and tried to get up, but he could barely move due to something soft and mysterious holding him down. How is this possible? I have restrain resistance and other movement hindrance resistance items. The moment I was completely immobilized, I should have been freed... This means the opponent has a high level restrain skill! Ainz looked at the creature that was trying to restrain him and confirmed that it was Albedo, as he had suspected. "Ainz-samaaaaa!" After straddling Ainz with both legs and firmly mounting him she raised her upper body. "W-what is it? What's the matter?!" "I don't need to... hold it in anymore, right!" Albedo opened her eyes wide. Her pupils that seemed to split her golden irises apart gave Ainz a chilling sensation down his back. "W-what are you talking about?!" Ainz panicked, but Albedo ignored him and put her hands on her dress, closing her fingers around the slit of her cleavage. With a grunted "Hmph!" she tried to rip it apart, but the material did not budge. "Magical clothing is annoying. I should use an item destruction skill or just take it off normally."
