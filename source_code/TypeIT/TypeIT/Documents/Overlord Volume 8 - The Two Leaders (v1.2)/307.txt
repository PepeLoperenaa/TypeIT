"I still haven't figured out why he created the persona of Momon the adventurer, but he's truly scary... For everything to have been part of his plan from then until now..." "You mean Ainz-sama disguised as the adventurer Momon? What about it?" "You'll learn soon enough... It's because he has Momon. He will become the foundation of Ainz-sama's rule. He's truly great... Even Demiurge's plans might actually be the result of Ainz-sama's guidance-" "What might you be murmuring about? It is a bit scary." Albedo pulled herself together at Shalltear's words and coughed a bit before looking at the other three. "What was I saying again? Yes, yes! Ainz-sama's words and actions have deeper meanings behind them. Even though it might be impossible to fully comprehend his intentions, try to put some effort into understanding his plans." "It's too difficult. Ainz-sama's too smart. Ah, it's a Spear Needle." Two gigantic white lumps with a height of more than two meters slowly waddled their way to Aura from the middle of the village. They were monsters that looked like angora rabbits. "They are very cute." Shalltear was petting one of the white bunches of fur standing beside Aura.
