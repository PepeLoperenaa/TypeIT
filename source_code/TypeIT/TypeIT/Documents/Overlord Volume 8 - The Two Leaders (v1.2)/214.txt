   The troll stared briefly at a wooden, human-made house and made its move. That was because it thought all the houses had the smell of soft, delicious humans, but that was just leftover scent. After confirming there were no other scents in the area, it began striding toward the direction where the sound of battle was coming from. The sound of humans fighting its brethren made it drool non-stop, and in its mind, it thought of the humans that would be there. A soft, lovely feast of human flesh. As a connoisseur among trolls, it loved the meaty limbs and disliked the bitter torso. Therefore, it was rare that it could eat its fill, but now it looked like it would get the chance to do just that. Its strides grew longer and it started to drool in anticipation. However, the troll halted and looked carefully around its surroundings. Or rather, he looked into the shadows of a nearby house. There were ogres. The smell of ogres was wafting out from there.
