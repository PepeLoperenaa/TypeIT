"They're on the move! They're heading this way!" If one were to listen, they could hear the sounds of the monsters rending the night. "Defense force to your positions! Ane-san, watch out! Ani-san too!" "Yes yes, I got it! Don't any of you die, please!" "Of course!" "Now then, Enri, shall we?" Nfirea ran up to Enri as her escort. Their job was to patrol the houses to see if anyone hadn't noticed the emergency. As they watched Enri leave, the goblins stood to battle stations. "Self-defense force, to your places  and done. The enemy is entering the target area." There was no direct line of fire to the monsters on the other side of the wall. Shooting an unseen target would require firing in an arc, but that wasn't something any amateur could do, and training to be able to do that would take too long. As a result, the goblins had decided to try something else.
