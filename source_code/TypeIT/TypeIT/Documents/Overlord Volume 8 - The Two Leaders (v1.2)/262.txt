"I've only been to saunas in the original world. I just wanted to submerge myself as soon as I found out I could take a bath... Maybe bathing is an integral part of being Japanese?" Ainz sunk deeper into the slime while imitating the motion of sighing. A slippery sensation slowly wrapped around his body. Since it posed no danger to him, he thought of it as a very sticky liquid instead. If I wanted to bathe normally, it would have been a pain. Ainz looked down at the most inconvenient part of his body to clean: his ribs. To wash them one by one took an inordinate amount of effort. He remembered how much time he had to put into it the last time and even though he was not capable of breathing, let out a sigh. That was not the only annoying place to clean. His spine was a problem as well. Due to the protrusions on the bones, the towels would constantly get snagged there. Meticulous effort was needed. At first, Ainz cleaned every single nook and cranny, but even with his strong mental fortitude, he was sick of it. He wondered what kind of cruel joke it was to take over thirty minutes just to clean his body. Then he tried whirling around in soapy water like how washing machines span around. It wasn't bad, but the problem was that he did not feel clean at all. If he didn't scrub his body with something, it never felt like all the dirt was washed off him. Next he tried a cleaning brush with a handle attached to it. It was truly a fine idea.
