type monsters. There were also other subspecies that had different colours called "red palter of false wealth" and "black palter of false wealth". What differentiated it from other elder liches was the fact it wore an armband on its left arm. The words "Librarian J" were written on it. "Welcome, Mare-sama." The elder lich bowed while speaking in a cracked voice that was barely audible. It bowed respectfully with one hand on its chest. "I-I came to see the Chief Librarian. Is he, uh, in the inner chambers?" The elder lich looked as if it was thinking for a second before replying. "The Chief Librarian started crafting scrolls not too long ago, so he should be in the Crafting Room." "Thank you." "I shall guide you to him. Right this way." "It's alright! I don't want to interrupt you." "Please do not mind it. It is our role to help the visitors." It would be rude to reject him after all this. "Alright, thank you then."
