"Well, what about it! Since you summoned the bicorn, let's move on to the next experiment!" "Alright." While Shalltear was staring her down, Albedo turned around, stepped on a stirrup and mounted the beast with such a light movement for someone who was fully armoured. The moment she sat on the saddle, she could feel the bicorn's body shuddering when they came in contact. "What's wrong?!" Albedo let out a loud exclamation in surprise. Her bicorn, which was level 100, should not be staggering around so easily. Then she remembered when she petted it. Perhaps the problems started back then, but what was the cause? "Aura! Shalltear! My bicorn's acting weird. Can you check it out?" The two realized that the bicorn was already staggering and could barely stand. "Eeeh, come down first, Albedo." "A-alright." Albedo finally thought about it after listening to Aura. The bicorn staggered and finally collapsed. It was breathing hard and the skin was full of sweat.
