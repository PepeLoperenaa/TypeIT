If he could just hold on, the goblins would save him. This was what Enri thought, as her heart was shredded by guilt. This was really a stroke of bad luck. If it hadn't been like this "There!" Enri was pointing to Nfirea, in front of them. And towering over him, the troll was raising its fist. They couldn't reach him. The distance was just too far. The troll's hand fell like a thunderbolt. It could destroy a house in a single blow. Nfirea was dead beyond all reasonable doubt. As she closed her eyes, she heard the goblins gulp in surprise. Their out-of-place response led Enri to nervously open her eyes "Aaaahhhh, your HP's in the red You okay?" And she saw a beautiful woman holding a gigantic weapon.
