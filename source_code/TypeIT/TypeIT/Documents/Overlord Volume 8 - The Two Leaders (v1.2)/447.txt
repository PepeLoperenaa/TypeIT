Then, after this will be the credits. Many thanks to So-bin-san, who solved many problems even as the work grew ever greater. Thanks to the designers at Chord Design Studio, the proofreader Osako-san, the editor F-ta san, as well as to everyone who helped me make Overlord. In addition, many thanks to honey, who spotted a lot of mistakes. And finally, thank you to all the readers out there. I hope to speak to you again in the future. December 2014 Maruyama Kugane
