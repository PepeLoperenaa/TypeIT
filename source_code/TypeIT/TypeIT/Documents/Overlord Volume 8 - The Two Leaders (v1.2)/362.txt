"I don't know the details, but I saw this young lady going towards the checkpoint with some soldiers. Then suddenly-" Even though he heard the summary, it was hard to discern the details. Ainz stuck his head out and listened in towards the direction of the check point. He could hear a loud shout when he listened carefully. Hmmm. Ainz's curiosity was stimulated. When he first arrived at E-Rantel, he was asked several questions as well, but in the end he could enter easily. He almost felt that guards were rather friendly towards common folk like adventurers and travellers. There was probably a real reason why they were friendly to him, but what kind of interrogation was that country girl undergoing? Because his adamantite rank was universal in nature, there were few cities which would not allow Ainz inside. So Ainz wanted to know what they were asking her. In the future, he might need to infiltrate a city as someone who was not an adamantite-ranked adventurer, Momom. To avoid any problems which might result at that point, he wanted to be prepared. "Wait here. I'll check it out." "I shall go with you." "There's no need. I'll be very brief."
