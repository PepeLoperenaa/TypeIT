Enkaishi's medicinal value resided in its roots. But you couldn't just pull the roots out like that. Grasses like these were incredibly hardy, and they would grow again as long as the roots remained. It seemed a shame, but depleting this patch of herbs (which had been quite a challenge to find in the first place) by overharvesting it would be like killing the goose which laid the golden egg. A strong odor seared her nose as she did the picking, but since she was used to that sort of thing, the smell didn't impede her work. Compared to Nfirea's house, this smell was like heaven. She plucked the herbs stalk by stalk, holding the harvest under her armpits to avoid crushing it by accident, and then carefully placed it into the bag. If the goblins came to help, they would probably have finished faster, but they were too busy watching their surroundings. Enri wasn't nearly stupid enough to take them off their sentry duty to help her. In comparison, Nfirea's harvesting methods were like poetry in motion. He swiftly pulled them out of the ground without pause, in such a way that didn't damage their potency as medicine. This technique would even impress fellow professionals in his field. Enri silently watched Nfirea, who was staring at the herbs with a diligent expression on his face. The face that had become so familiar looked like someone else's before her. ...He's a man now. "...What's happened?" Nfirea suddenly raised his head. He must have sensed the stoppage in Enri's work. Although she'd done nothing, Enri still lowered her head in embarrassment.
