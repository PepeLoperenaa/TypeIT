"...I don't know what to do even if we do have a vacation. We were made to guard the Great Tomb and serve the Supreme Beings. To work is our very existence..." "However, since Ainz-sama told us to take a break. We must take a break." The reason why three of them were gathered was because their master said: "All of you work so hard every day. Why don't all the female guardians take some time off and spend it together every once in a while?" It was because of that. "Well, since we went out together and spent some time together, should we disperse? But does this really count as spending some time together?" "Good question. If he asks if we spent some time together, how much time is appropriate? Speaking of which, what do you guys usually do with your time?" "I patrol between the 1st and the 3rd floors. I also gather the opinions of the area guardians, check the security status of the floors, and when I have free time, I take a bath and touch up my makeup..." "You work harder than expected." "What might you mean by 'expected'?"
